Description: The EmoReader package is created to analyze the sentiments of the reviews from the user which is then converted to 10 different emotions from the reviews. Text mining is performed through this package to find out the important words that provide meaningful information about the reviews that the products receive. Furthermore, it can also be used for a text document to find  different emotions involved.
    The package seggregates the review into 10 emotion using the get_nrc_sentiment function and scores them accordingly as per the emotion that occurs.
