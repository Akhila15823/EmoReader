5,"As advertised. Everything works perfectly, I'm very happy with the camera. As a matter of fact I'm going to buy another one for my 2nd car."
5,it's great
5,These work great and fit my life proof case for the iPhone 6
4,Work very well but couldn't get used to not hearing anything out of the ear they v were plugged into.
2,"Be careful with these products, I have bought several of these cameras and the image is pretty decent but battery doesn't hold any charge!!!!"
3,"It appears to be good, but I'm still waiting for my other items radio,batteries,charger, before I can go to 4 or 5 stars"
3,"First one arrived as a brick.  Wouldn't work, wouldn't charge, useless.  Exchanged for a new one that works as advertised."
5,Worked great for vacation
4,"this is a very good item, it provide me the sound that i like.."
5,"I LOVE my recorder. Bought it obviously because I have tape cassette's with no way to play them.<br />Spent an AMAZING afternoon, listening to my Mom (who passed away in 2005), tell a 90 minute Christmas story of &#34;Nicholas&#34;,  to my two daughters, many moons ago.  It was a wonderful afternoon of laughter and tears.<br />I thank you, for providing me, the time to spend an afternoon with my Mom again... :)"
5,"Great sound great battery beach, work, park, anywhere battery lasts"
3,"If what you want is a continuous tone piezo - i.e. a &#34;beeper&#34; - then this one would get 5  or maybe 4 stars.  (Possibly dock one star because it's a bit quiet for the rated sound level.)  However, if what you wanted was the thing described in the listing - i.e. a *buzzer*, for example something that would make the sound you get if you answer incorrectly on a game show &#34;bzzzzt&#34; - then it's 3 stars at best.  This is the 3rd batch of &#34;buzzers&#34; I've ordered from different suppliers so this is not an isolated incident.  Anyone need some beepers, cheap?"
5,Love it
1,Sucks
2,u need to plug in both
5,Worked with MHD Flasher for Android.  Used to flash performance tunes to BMW 135i/335i N54 engines.
2,"Just arrived,  read instructions and attacked my #1 to key chain. Installed battery but for the life of me, was unable to CLOSE the cap. 100 times and still no go. #1 is out and apparently is broken. Tried #2 and did mange to close the cap. Have not tried #3 or #4 yet. Surely they can make a quality cover for the device. Thinking of returning the item and look for better quality battery cover. The font on the instructions are  too tiny to read, sure you can afford a larger print. No phone number or web address to contact for a replacement of #1. Hmmm...maybe you KNEW you had an inferior battery cover and  didn't care to deal with the complaints!"
5,I bought this unit as a replacement for my portable fish finder. Works great as did the original. I replaced it because the original was accidentally damaged.
4,"I am giving the speakers a test drive as I write this review. I am deeply impressed by the sound quality of this little box. The high end is really nice. The bass is somewhat lacking, but, I didn't expect room-shaking bass anyway. These are a keeper!!!"
5,Met my application needs very well.
5,This dash cam gives me life. I am an african american and anyone with a television knows that racial profiling of minorities is a huge problem in America. I got my dash cam to record my trips but I also use it to record any police stops. So far no stops. Yay me BUT I took the scenic route to the beach and pointed my camera at the ocean as I drove. Beautiful. The video is crystal clear and vivid. I like it so much my husband wants one too. I recieved this dash cam at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of how well it performed.
2,Scratchy when keyed up
5,Great
5,"This was a gift from a friend a year ago and I thought it would be just an average little speaker. For my surprise, this product is awesome, sounds great and I would definitely consider buy another one."
5,i love the sound of skar and in the right box these are louder than any PSI around.. i have had 1 10' skar vd in a ported box for a &#34;SINGLE CAB CHEVY&#34; and iv out beat many larger systems... its a great product and i will stay with skar before i go back to kickers
5,Can't go out with it!!!! best gadget for music lovers...
4,Was everything I expected
1,"I was excited to get this product because it looked versatile and cute and I thought I could take it with me on the road.  However, after receiving it and trying it out I was disappointed to say the least.  The volume button does not work at all.  It is really stiff and difficult to move manually.  The control works, but it is small and could get lost if one is not careful.  The capacity for sound is limited.  Also the cables to connect the speakers were flimsy and not working properly.  Overall very disappointed with this purchase.  I contacted amazon for return and found out that we are responsible for shipping costs with this seller. I Found out the cheapest UPS ground services to be after packaging close to $30.00! This is crazy to have to pay this for a defective product.  So save your money and headache and buy something else.  Trust me, I hate to give bad reviews, but this is a sound equipment that you should skip!"
5,"Outstanding, great price and I like the larger screen"
5,Nice little unit with great sound.  Built well and easy to use - great for travelling.  The hands-free phone feature is a nice plus.
5,Life savers
5,"Great range, about 30-50 feet, very clear, works with any audio input jack whether on an iPod, iPad, or computer monitor. Love it"
5,My family and I like it so.much it has a good sound and we can take it anywhere we want.
5,Works as advertised.  Pairs easily and re-pairs without effort.
4,"Good dashcam.  This is my second G1W-C.<br /><br />Likes: 1080p max resolution, rearview mirror mount, nice screen, no battery, affordable, free pen.<br /><br />Dislikes: loses time/date if car is parked for a few days (no battery, only capacitor), UI controls are tricky, free pen."
5,I just love this item. Thanks and plan to get more from this provider.
5,The big advantage that the Kobo has over the Kindle is that pubic libraries do not support Kindle.  You can not use a kindle to download books from your local library.
1,"First off, we need the operating band this is designed for.  It is not foldable or collapsable.  Also need the connector type.<br />You will not sell many of these without supplying more information."
5,"I bought this primarily to be used as a flashlight and it has worked out well over the last five weeks. I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple."
3,I have another Bluetooth speaker from another maker and this one was very easy to use but the volume  up louder doesn't sound as good as the other one.
5,X x vc&#34;ccc
5,"Sounds awesome and works great, pioneer coming in clutch."
5,"This is my first Dashcam and I love it!  This was much smaller that I thought, but the smaller the better, can't be seen easily by others.  I live in the city, lots of cars, stop lights and traffic.  Though I have not had accident since having installed this, I have reviewed footage and image was super clear for daytime video and better that I expected, very clear night vision.  I can see how this dashcam can come in handy for so many instances that could happen.  It was easy to install, we used a silicone adhesive for that extra security.  I think this dashcam is a good buy and I think everyone should have one these days.  I was able to try this at a discount for my honest review."
5,The cord did it's job and locks into your ipod/phone pretty well. I am able to pull my ipod to me by the cord which is nice.
4,"Good product so far, it fits my Zune very well."
3,"Like all portable players, leaves much to be desired. Good for the battery usiness"
5,it is an excellent product easy to install worth the price
5,I am really enjoying this speaker. I was unsure if it was as good as some of the reviews gave it but I am very pleased with the sound quality and the value.
5,"Good, strong, and 6 feet long."
5,Big screen is nice once the store contacted me on how to have voice directions
5,"I bought this as a gift for a friend.  I loaded a bunch of songs on it before giving it to her.  It was easy to load and seemed really easy to use, too.  User friendly, I guess is the right term.  I have an MP3 player I bought elsewhere but this one looked a lot nicer than mine.  My friend loved her gift.  She thought I spent a lot of money on it but really, the price was very reasonable."
5,Exactly what I needed
1,Does not fit XL
3,"I'm not sure what the use case is for this device. A build-in, dash-mounted display is generally pretty well shielded from glare by virtue of its location. A GPS on top of the dashboard and closer to the windshield may suffer from glare problems, but this sunshade needs to be taped to the GPS to stay in place. Overall, I would say this is a solution in search of a problem, overpriced for what it actually does.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received an evaluation unit in exchange for a fair and honest review."
2,"Purchased two of these based on a wide variety of reviews. The first one failed within a couple of hours of use, and the second one failed today.  The first one was replaced by Amazon and I haven't had a chance to use it much. This second one will simply be returned for a refund. The recording it made were excellent.  But what good does it do to have something that is unreliable?  Too bad."
5,Great product but long shipping.
2,The compass is not reliable.  I don't really know if it works
2,I was very disappointed! The charger will not charge my phone because it won't keep a charge. It very cheap looking and poor quality. It wasn't worth the money but you get what u pay for so I just went by to the Apple Store.
3,"Sometimes gets &#34;laggy&#34;. It was fron China which seller didn't indicate. I had lots of other products from China that had quality issues with electronics  overheating, shorting and just under performing. This unit didn't get hot and so far is working as advertised. My only concern because the app is a Chineese developed app, just don't know if the unit-app snoops my device. Have no way of knowing either:"
1,After plugging in my phone an alert came on saying &#34;this is not a legal device and will not charge your phone&#34;.  Hassle to return it but just beware to anyone thinking of buying it.
5,"Apple makes their charging products with inferior quality to profit off of loyal customers when they are forced to repurchase. Save your money here, these are exactly what I was looking for, made with excellent materials at the joints between the cable and plug-in. Well worth it, added length and color options are a plus."
2,"This thing doesn't stick to the wall. It takes forever to connect to my phone, but forget trying to have two different people using two different phones intermittently. Frankly, the sound quality isn't great either and my phone has better speaker and sound quality."
5,A gift so I cannot give much information about them. They look great and came on time though.
5,Love love love loved it
5,the unit fully met my expectations. Delivery was prompt.
1,"I feel that the DVR is working good but the battery inside is not good as short time, I bought this DVR and used only in 2 two days the battery dead.<br />and the cover out side has been coming out of the DVR. please make it better to get your market!!!"
3,"Stores a lot of music, it sounds good. It is very very difficult to maneuver the menus, not intuitive and the instructions are too minimal. It seems like all the features work, but being able to use them is a lot of work."
5,satisfied
5,Easy to use
3,"The speaker looks nice and was easy to set up. However, the description states it can be up to 30 ft away from your bluetooth device and it's really only about 10 ft or it constantly loses connection."
5,Very good. good  seller
1,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
3,ok
5,Awesome product
5,Good Dashcam; gives nice clear video
5,Nice
3,Sounds great but still over priced
1,Two failed
4,Works great! Loud. Very impressed
5,Is everything I expected and then some
4,UNIT WORKS SIMILAR TO ONE IT IS REPLACING. THIS UNIT ONLY APPEARS TO HAVE A 100 WATT OUTUT. I CHECKED WITH MANUFACTURER THEY THOUGHT IT COULD BE MY VOLTMETER. ALL MY APPLIANCES WORK. THERE IS A HUM COMING FROM THIS UNIT AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS ONE I HAD.
5,surprised it STILL works
5,My dad did like this case for his Nook I bought him.
1,"I've bought a lot of products on Amazon...like we purchase several times a week.  In most cases, we get what we expect.  I was skeptical in purchasing these and saw mixed reviews, but these guys claim to be &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; and are &#34;genuine&#34;.  Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.  The worst part now, is that I have passed the one month window to return these because once back from my trip, I've had to deal with some work emergencies.  So I've basically just wasted my hard earned money on garbage, with no more option for refund."
1,Poor quality and low sound output for its size.  A real disappointment.
5,"I bought this Mount Holder for my iPad for the trip to Orlando and to stop holding my iPad with my hands all the time. The iPad Air, what I have, fits very well and feels very secure in this case and I love the idea of having my hands free, the material feels very resistant and keep it in the car that way I don't forget to pack it for any long ride or trip"
4,Very good quality. So far so good.
1,The worst quality. I only used it twice and its already done. Won't transmit the sound. I'm so mad... I keep my things nice and I'm careful with my my gadgets. I wasn't expecting it to preform so poorly... Very dissatisfied...
4,"good, I converted my idle speakers into bluetooth speakers where I can play songs from my phone."
4,"It was listed as having a remote-antenna jack, which it does not have. Otherwise, works well, with limited, indoor A/M reception."
4,"Thwy work great especially for the price. I mainly got these to use as an alternative for a baby monitor because of the vox setting. Thought was i could go around the house, the garage, the yard.  And still hear the little one. But the vox gain is not sensitive enough to hear her until she is really mad. Even after buying the cable and adjusting the vox gain to the max. So it didn't work for that.  But camping, sending them with the kids while there playing, and letting the kids just play with them. I got my money out of them."
1,Sorry to say this did not charge our i-pods at all. Darn.
4,"it came packed very well in two boxes. The radio looks new, but it is missing the antenna, I can use the one from my old radio. But it still works great"
5,"Very good unit put it in my wifes 2014 jeep , she loves it."
5,very good
5,"This Portable speaker was for a christmas present for my mom, she was looking for something small but at the same time with a good volume she is happy with it and I am happy too!"
5,This mount was a replacement for a previous RAM mount that broke. It fits and functions just as expected - very well !!
5,my daughter loves this case
4,"This rear view mirror is very decent for its price.  The video is clear and the mirror is fairly easy to install.  It has lots of features such as long battery life, motion sensor video mode, gps hook up (if you have your own) and plenty of options.  There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.  Overall though I am pretty pleased with this mirror and recommend that everyone have one if for nothing else other than an insurance policy."
1,"It made a loud train sound and I couldn't turn off, I tried everything. Also there's nowhere on the device to power my phone. This is a fake"
5,Thanks
5,This iPod works great!  I use it to swim laps and so far very happy with it!!!!
5,Works great
4,"Works pretty nicely, but the sound quality is between fair and poor."
3,"One dead on arrival, one working as intended."
5,"Works great, easy to install."
5,seems legit.cable is pretty thick handles power well and has a nice thick tuff jacket
5,Good product and good seller
1,Had to have the original purchase replaced and then had to send the replacement replaced as the batteries will not charge/hold a charge. Don't waste your time.
5,Excellent
1,"I have purchased it because I have seen a new product with a great review. I have paid $160 for similar looking camera for my wifes car which works great, so after seeing similar nice looking product with a great price I decided to try it. First it was working ok for a couple of days and was taking good quality hd video, then started turning off by itself. Sending back"
5,My iPhone recognized this cable and never told me it was not supported. It didn't overheat my phone and it charged it in a very reasonable pace. I have had it for 4 and a half months and it just last week when the white one started to damage but that happens with almost all iPhone chargers even the one that comes with the device. The black one still alright. I'm going to place another order now.
3,Quality ok but not great but price is good. Battery operated--no adaptor came with this player.
2,"Has weak reception using jvc head unit. I have this on another car using sony head unit, which seem to work better."
5,Excelente producto
4,Product received as advertised
3,Good looking unit. Sounds great. Easy install. Apps are run from phone and are all junk Imo. Be sure to buy the bypass if you arent hooking up the controll harness or it wont let you play any video if it cant tell you are in park. Still a very nice radio.
1,Its not two pieces buy only two channels you only get one despite the description saying the opposite
2,It is what it is. Pretty cheap player. I wouldn't recommend it. It was inexpensive though.
5,"I absolutely love this darn thing.  I looks great, it sounds great and it has an amazing battery life."
5,Perfect case! Love it
5,Like the bigger screen.
5,"[[VIDEOID:abde57fdd35925f99d6c2e46f2fdb21b]] See my video for my thoughts and opinions here.<br /><br />I had to find a car in which I could use this item...it worked rather well and was very easy to use. It slides into place VERY firmly as you will see in the video. Seems to snug up well when inserted and really doesn't look too bad when installed.<br /><br />Plenty of adjustability and easy to remove quickly if needed. Such a simple design not much else to say...hope the video helps.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
4,Product received as advertised
3,"It culd be better, but it is seems to be not well finished"
2,Not real handy to open
5,Bumps and holds my 15 &#34; Memphis mojo had it now for a few months and still holding strong.
5,good purchase
5,Unbelievably clear sound and great bass from a speaker that weighs less than a pound.
5,Great product!
5,good price and product.
4,good value
5,Works great. ..still using it everyday a year and a half later.
5,I liked it so much I bought a second one. The sound is great and it is easy to use.
5,"Very little capacity spread, but some self discharge. Using them to augment a marginal starting system on my 1975 Mercer boat. They dropped the starter response time from 500 mS to less than  250. Perfect!"
1,IPod nano doesn't work even after trying to charge several times with different USB cables. Returning product!
5,definitely notice the difference so does everybody else great buy perfect price excellent investment
4,Ok
5,Amazing for every game exempt gta5 because it's not well optimized but this can stream every game you want at high settings 40-50fps
2,Very flimsy. It doesn't work with new technology by just touching like an IPAD. You have to remember which one is the back button to go from example: Video to Music.
5,great
4,They charge my wife's phone
5,it play great and I use it ever day
5,Works great with good sound for its small size. Fills up a room!
1,Did not work. Dont Buy for Corolla
1,Piece of junk
5,I needed USB cords in lengths longer than 6ft. These fit my requirements perfectly.
5,I bought this a while ago and I think it's one of the best portable bluetooth speakers out there for the Amazon Price.  I like that it's not a rechargeable and uses regular batteries (so you can use rechargeable batteries if you choose) AND it has a plug.  The sound is loud and clear.
5,Great replacement.  No problems
5,The product is excillent.
3,Mic doesn't work clearly often
5,Works
5,This is a must have for single handed sailing. I simply can't believe much this product is needed. Can't live without it
5,It takes a while to charge and it only last for a little bit but when it lights up it looks really cool !!
5,both work great and are still working
5,brings me back to the old days
5,Works like a charm!
5,"I've ordered a ton of these white and black, long and short.  I keep buying them because they are made so well.  I need more to buy for the office, my car, the house...etc... awesome stuff!"
5,They work great.  Quite durable.  I would get them again.
5,This speaker works well and looked brand new. The sound is great and shipping was fast. I will be purchasing more products from Beach Camera on Amazon.
1,It broke less than a month. Don't buy them.
5,Very nice and compact and easy to install.
5,I've bought a total of 3 of these cables I've had the first for over a month and works great. Lasted longer than the ones I got from Apple. I needed one that worked with my lifeproof case and this does
3,"Does not auto shut off, loud but distorts at high volume, will be replacing with another speaker."
5,Product works as promised
5,"Just like the original but with style, helps us keep our keys separate for the two GMC products we own."
1,too small
5,"The best charging cables out there. I've tried cheaper ones and they always stop working. ive had these for a while now, and they work every time."
5,Works fine.
5,Just what I wanted.  Love the new cords
5,"Works great, and really fast delivery."
5,"Got it on Prime when it was only $5.99. Figured it was worth a shot for such a low price. Added it to an older A/V receiver and it is working as intended. Supplied cords were really short, and though it is supplied with a micro usb cable it is not supplied with an AC adapter for the cable. Pairing was simple, just plugged it in and my phone connected to it on the first try. Haven't tried the NFC functionality due to my phone's current rom having it disabled, but I'm sure it works fine. It works every bit as well as other bluetooth receivers I've purchased in the past for five times the price. I will probably purchase another one if this one continues working well."
5,very good thanks
4,"Quality of song good, only one problem with remote control, when cassete inside."
5,"Important: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CD SLOT RIGHT ABOVE YOUR GPS FOR THIS TO WORK<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ It works 100% with a GPS system that has a CD slot on top<br />‚Ä¢ Minimal design that fits right in<br />‚Ä¢ Easy to remove/ install<br /><br />Thoughts:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ There is a slight rattle when going over bumps<br />‚Ä¢ The directions are awful but you can figure it out by the Amazon Pics<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Buy this if you have the right GPS set up as described above. It will keep the glare of your GPS screen‚Ä¶especially if you drive with the sunroof open.  Please note that I was able to test this product at a discount in order to provide you with an honest, unbiased review."
5,Good
5,Works great for my iPhone and IPad.  And much less expensive than Apple's products.
1,Don't buy it if your desktop is not compatible for windows 7
5,they work great!  haven't had any issues and i've had them for about 6 months.
5,amazing
5,Good product as advertised. Would have liked to be more obvious that the radio did not include a battery. But still happy with product.
5,"This cable works lightening-fast. As soon as I plug it into my iPhone, it recognizes the charger instantly and begins charging immediately. No need to wiggle the cable around the port to get it to fit properly or for the device to pick it up. I actually think it works better than the charger my iphone came with! I've had it for over a year now and the wire is still in excellent shape. No tears to the cable, like you often have with apple headphones or other chargers, plus the wire is still neat and clean hasn't really accumulated any dirt or smudges (I bought the white one so that says a lot). The cable also stays straight, i.e. it also doesn't tangle or twist into a knot that you need to untangle. Whether you're looking for a primary iphone charger or a secondary charging cable for your car or for traveling, this product gets the job done!<br /><br />Overall, a great item at a great price (no need to overpay at the Apple store). It works very well and still lasts and looks pretty much the same as the day I bought it. Well done with the manufacturing, definitely no knock-off experience here!"
1,"Easy to install, sounded great for about three weeks and then the AMP shorted out or something to blow the main fuse. Sent it back several weeks ago and when enquiring about its ETA they told me the end of September because they are on back order. With no service after the sale I will NEVER buy another Rockford Fosgate product!!!! Ridiculous..."
5,"It works for me!  I'm using it for my PS4 controller.  Why?  Cause the controller loses charge VERY quickly. It's common knowledge.<br />Can't go wrong with these cables. Just don't forget, if wireless is a promise, you'll be begging for wired in a heartbeat."
4,"Managed to pick this beauty up on sale for about $15. I was so impressed I ordered two more and gave them away as gifts. The sound is pretty darn good for such a small device and with a passive bass speaker on the back its' audio is quite stellar. The body is a mixture of silicone rubber and high density plastic, with metal grills on the front, and a rubber strap for carrying.<br /><br />Outdoors, it won't scare away the livestock or set off seismic activity sensors but is perfect for a tent or a small room. As an added bonus you can insert a micro hard drive on the back and play your music directly from that, so it technically qualifies as an MP3 player, albeit one with minimal controls. It doesn't have any IPX proofing, so I would try and keep it away from water. Having said that for $15, you can take this to the swimming pool and should it get soaked you won't feel like you got um, soaked."
4,Did the job
5,"As always, you get great quality and sound from BOSE ! Thank you Amazon"
5,Got my portable fan working again.
5,Great!
3,"Alright, so I wasn't expecting much. That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness! I hate it when I crash my car and it disoperates, but with a push of a button it will get right!"
3,"Pros:<br />Great size.  Really nice, full sound.  Strong bluetooth range.<br />Haven't tested the water-proof abilities and probably won't.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The NFC pairing seems non-existent.  The manual tells me to put the phone on an NFC label that simply is not there.  Why do I care?  Well, there is a voice that tells you when you connect/disconnect.  Part of me likes knowing but the problem is that when I'm in another part of my house and coming in and out of range there is an odd male voice upstairs scaring my kids.  Well. maybe just freaking them out a little.  I bought this, in part, because the NFC should let me connect when I'm in the room and disconnect when I walk out.  Instead, I can't do that.<br /><br />So while I really like the sound and size I'm debating if I will return this due to a non-existent feature."
5,"I bought the polka-dot ipod cases for my granddaughter.  They fit perfectly, and she loves the colors.  She especially enjoys giving her ipod a new look each day!"
5,use this with my ipod while riding my motorcycle . works great!! highly recommend it.
5,"Been very picky and had a very hard time find a case for my Nook, but soooo glad I got this one because I love it!! Makes my nook look just as small and compact as it really is!!"
3,"For iPhone 6 and VW, Audi MMI supports only charging! No iPod functions, no music or videos, no data :-("
4,"I recently purchased the Jensen Portable Cassette Player/Recorder to replace my 40-year old Panasonic counterpart, which had been my trusted mainstay until it malfunctioned during an important Association Board Meeting.  From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars."
5,works great!  fits iPhone 6 with no problems.
5,Used this for two side by side freezers instead of a fridge/freezer combo unit. Works great.
5,"I bought this so I could have something to listen to on a cross country drive in a U-haul, it worked perfect. Speaker is nice, clear, and pretty loud but don't expect some earth shattering bass. Battery lasted the promised 10 hours, I didn't have the voice that other reviews mentioned when the battery gets low, instead it gives a loud beep a couple of times before going dead. My only complaint is the power cord, it's a short USB cable without a power adapter, so you either charge it on a computer or you buy your own. Over all though for the price I paid I am very happy with this, would definitely recommend."
5,"I bought a Two cables,  one for me one for my precious ppl.  We both satisfied, Good Quality and nice price."
1,Doesn't charge my phone. Doesn't pick up calls right away. Doesn't play the sound in the background!!! SUCKS DO NOT BUY
1,Had this for almost three months and it started to act up. There was no visual signs of any broken issues. The cord would charge the phone and then randomly stop charging.
3,as advertised thanks
1,"Very poor quality. Not worth the purchase. i ordered this to put my music on so i can have it when i went into labor and was not able to use it. i was able to load my music on but i could not get it to play certain songs, shuffle or play more than one song at a time. it basically played a song then stopped. i would have to hit play again and it would play the same damn song unless i searched through for another song. i don't know if this was was just defective or what, but i will never try this product again."
5,"I have a 250 cc scooter, it came with a player built in but it was junk and I wanted something better.  after looking at a lot of systems I chose this one because most others the speakers mount to the handle bars, on mine it was not possible.  the description for these really didn't say how they mounted, turns out they mount to the mirrors, you unscrew the mirror, then put the the mount under the post, tighten the mirror and it's there. the only complaint I have is there are no instructions, it's not hard to mount or wire but I think there should be some basic info anyway.  they sound great, at 60 mph I can hear most songs on the usb thumb drive i'm currently using.  there are lights inside the speakers that play with the music, but they are not bright enough to bother night vision.  overall i'm highly impressed"
5,"Working out great so far.  Not quite as flexible as Apple cables, but not as stiff as others I've used."
4,super cute but kinda hard to take on and off.
5,Worked just fine with my kids' iphones.
1,bad
5,Timely shipment.  Great product.
5,"Prompt shipping, product has no defects and works as expected. No complaints."
4,Works fine. Just had push a little hard to get the plug to seat.
5,Excellent product in a good price. You can't ask for anything better than that in retail.
5,Great product and buy
5,Love this
1,This subwoofer did not sound all that great when I first got it and it blew in less then a month of using. I had the proper watts running to it. It's just a bad product. Pioneer has defiantly gone down hill.
1,I have had this unit for a couple of years.  I bought it to run and portable oxygen concentrator while on the road since the 12v aux feed from my Prius does not provide the amps needed.  It has worked fine on a couple of road trips.  Just today I put a high quality volt meter on the ac output and was astonished to find that it only put out 90v.  Under load or no load.  With this low voltage there is a potential to damage any electronics that expects the ac voltage to be in the range of 105v - 125v.  This is why I gave it only one star.
5,"Great product, love that i can record our road trips and also keep it just in case any trouble were to happen along our journey."
1,I had these speakers for about a month now and two out of the four I installed have blown out already. Consider other options unless you want to keep replacing them
1,This item does not work.
1,2 of the cords were bad and one of the boxes was bad.  3 out of 4 items were not working.  That's pretty bad odds.
5,Both cables work as expected. No warning message from the iPhone either!
5,Great quality. I'll buy them again.
5,Great alternative for Apple Lightning Cable
1,This did not work at all.  The brand new cd's skipped constantly.  It would just stop all of a sudden.  Not a good product at all.
5,Works beautifully!  Quality exceeded my expectations!
5,awesome
5,"awesome product, not a thin flimsy cable like the OEM part from Apple.  This is very durable and has zero connectivity issues.  I should have bought this a long time ago, and the two pack price is great."
4,Fits as expected
5,"These are really sturdy cables, charged my phone and tablet quickly stayed in tight. I'm sure they will last a long time."
5,"Used this with MHD flasher to flash a tune and used Carly BMW for some coding. No issues at all with the cable, worked perfectly with my 2007 BMW E92 335i"
1,"This piece of crud literally lasted 7 days before just refusing to work altogether. I meant to review earlier when it died but forgot. It's build nice and you'd think it would work well, but nope.<br /><br />Also, an ill side effect of using this with iPhone 6 is you'll sometimes get the signal bleeping through the transmitter. I think this is one of the few car powered units, however, that picks up the least amount of buzz from electrostatic interference of the car when you're both powering the unit and your phone."
5,Got my product today! very well wrapped love it already
5,"Amazing stereo sound, bass, and volume. I love the easy touch front panel and the the fact it comes with every cord you need. Easy to use. Searched endless reviews and videos before I settled on this. Sounds much better than the Bose Bluetooth dock. Highly recommended."
5,I have ordered these twice now ( because my kids keep losing them !) and they hold up better than any others and charge the phone quickly
3,Good
1,No recomendado....
5,Great sound.
5,The Cheapest Best Car Invention Ever ! I Should've Bought This Sooner Instead Of iNvesting On Other FM Transmitors That Were Four Times More Expensive Than This. I Absoulutly Love iT ! The Only Thing iD Change iS The Lighting... it's Too Bright And Driving At Night I've Had Cops Look At Me But I Still Love iT !
2,Stopped working after four months. Complete garbage.
5,"Great product, would buy again."
5,If I could give it and the seller 10 stars I would!!! Awesome delivery and products
5,"I've had them all and this is by far the best. Well made, not cheap looking, very sturdy."
5,"[[VIDEOID:f1c616e6a1b875bb84b9089395cad59f]]This item is great it helps vent out your car, so on those hot days your car is a little cooler inside! This is very nice because you do not need batteries for it to work. The work that I do for a living this is great because my car sits for hours in the hot sun before I get to get back in it.  This is a lot better than leaving your windows down, when you leave your windows down that is probably when it is going to rain!  This is nice because I keep a lot of stuff in my car, one time I had a cell phone get to hot and I had to get a new battery for it! This would have helped me save some money! This fan actually moves a lot of air for how small it is!<br />I got this item at a discounted price for a honest review!"
5,Awesome cord does not bend at the end like the apple ones and I honestly put mine through hell not on purpose of course lol but it is still in great condition.
4,"[[VIDEOID:fa85e618a003596a96e0cd0a6b306a41]]Pairing Name: Omaker-M075<br />Paired with iPhone 4<br /><br />Audio Characteristics:  Punchy Bass, warm and clear overall spectrum.  Not very loud, however, as such things go.  At max, a moderate listening level.<br /><br />Fit/Build profile:  Has rubber feet for vertical positioning, yet plays well horizontally - just be aware that also covers the funky, oddball, what-on-earth Volume, Track AND Power all on a single hybrid slide dial & push button thing that did indeed befuddle me for a few minutes.  All the instructions say is \\""Turn It On\\"".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.  Just a) not a crunking volume, and b) surely a more standard method of powering, volume, and track selection could have been used...<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.efully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations."
5,Works great!
3,"Quality is ok, but the cables tend to fray around the connection end fairly quickly."
5,Got it in red and black and already in love with it. Hands down one of the best Bluetooth speakers in this price range. If you're looking for cheap Bluetooth speakers SoundBot SB571 is the way to go.
5,Great Case for the Nook.  My Mom likes the durability and handling of the NOOK in this case.
1,This is the worst radio I ever bought toch screen stop working very fast and the seller is the worst people to deal with don't buy from
5,nice product. works as expected. nothing to add :)
1,"Waited a month maybe longer, when it finally arrived it was not a Acten but some other model.<br />rear view camera works fine but navigation icon does not respond. Does not flow easily will return."
5,I have used several of these and love them.  I have used a different &#34;cheaper&#34; brand before but you'll soon receive the error that the cable is not the right one for this accessory.  Not with these!  Works!  Great value to buy in pairs.  I was able to stock up on my iPhone/ iPad Air 2 cables.
3,"FIRST THE GOOD:<br />  The battery life is OK.  I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.  This is standard for any device being charged by USB so don't blame the speaker if it takes forever to charge.<br />  The sound quality is decent.  Not a lot of bass but it's much better than the speakers that come on your cellphone and a lot louder as well.<br />  The suction cup on mine was awesome.  I stuck it to my windshield in the south Georgia heat for more than 2 weeks and it didn't fall off. (my car radio doesn't have bluetooth and I was listening to Pandora on a road trip)<br />  The volume level changes in small increments.  I have had other bluetooth audio devices that increment in large steps so you go from not quite loud enough to way too loud.  This one has small steps so it's easy to find the right audio level.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />  Definitely not &#34;Waterproof&#34; more like &#34;Water Resistant.&#34;  I purchased this for music while Kayaking.  It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.  The buttons are actually part of a rubber ring that goes all the way around the speaker.  I pulled the ring off and let it air dry and it works good as new.  It's worth the then bucks I paid but they should really change the description.<br />  The volume and track change buttons are the same buttons.  Long press for volume, short press to change tracks.  This can get annoying if you forget and tap the button trying to bump the volume up a bit (as happened to me frequently)"
5,Works good as ever!
5,"[[VIDEOID:fc6d7c0266a602f5e8ce06be09c08539]]This back up alarm is good to have if you live in a busy city it helps out a lot. It can take sometime to install if you don't know what your doing. I got this and installed in a couple of hours.  You get a power cable, 4 sensors, and alarm.  This is help you with backing up and making sure you don't hit anything or anyone.  This worked great in my 2nd car made it better for me to parallel park.<br />I got this item at a discounted price for a honest review."
1,It was loud at first and then after a couple weeks it kinda just gave up and wouldn't turn up even with the volume on my phone all the way up. And then the side of it came off I don't recommend it.
3,Works fine.
5,These were perfect! My daughter (7 yr old) has received my husband's old iPod Touch 4 and to make it special for her we wanted a case for it that would match her style. When we saw that this item came with four cases and two stylus we were sold! My daughter has so much fun picking out which case to switch to and they are easy for her to take off and put on but they stay on great! They fit perfectly and the price could not be beat. They arrived in perfect condition and on time. I highly recommend these!
5,Great
1,"I was pretty sure I did not want a radio with analog tuning. But I like Sony's Walkman that I use every day, so I thought I would try it. Not only is the analog tuning difficult to use but the reception is POOR. I have difficult getting 2 local stations good enough to hear and understand. This is the worst of many Sony products I bought. Do Not Buy This!!!!"
1,This sub is not 600 Watts Max so if you think its a good deal then you better not drive it with over 250 Watts or you will blow it like I did with 500 Watts. The spec is very misleading.
4,One works perfectly the other some times doesn't work right away when plugged in
5,I can actually read it!  Lifetime maps is wonderful.
5,once I got it going it seems to be very seficient  for my needs
5,These are the ones to buy.  I've messed around with the cheaper versions that stop working after a week or so.  These work just like the original cord that comes from Apple.
2,Colors were off and very difficult if not impossible to tilt camera up or down
5,"Seem to be well made, no issues as with cheaper products. Pleased with the purchase"
1,broke just taking it off
1,"This turned out to be a truly piece Chinese junk, it will not play DVD or CD.Company does not respond to e-mail sent them in regards to warranty so I can get it repaired. I canot file an A to Z claim. This is the worst purchase I have made. Do not buy from this Canadian company."
5,"Fantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it."
1,"Noisy, ineffective. Replacing with similar module with standard TRS."
1,Do not buy from them. I thought this was the whole visor which may have been my fault so when I just received a small metal piece with 2 screws i was shocked. A small metal piece for $25??? Anyway it wasn't what I needed so I requested to be able to return it. The email I received back was unbelievable. Very harsh. See below...<br /><br />don't understand. You say in your statement that you expected what was in the picture. There were 2 pictures of Broken visors. Are saying that is what you expected? Item is EXACTLY as described. The very first thing the Description and Listing states is that it is for a &#34;TOYOTA CAMRY SUN VISOR REPAIR KIT&#34;.  Listing and product description states FOURTEEN (14) TIMES that it is for REPAIR and is a REPAIR KIT.  Please explain where the &#34;Description Was Not Accurate&#34; as you have claimed. It certainly appears that you did not read the listing whatsoever which does not constitute a full refund.  Even so Buyer may return the repair kit but the following must be done before any refund will be issued.<br /><br />Very very unprofessional. I will not purchase from them again.
4,"Sounds pretty good for its size. It comes with a USB cable charger, an aux cable, a power switch and card reader/slot. Upper and bottom portions have silicon covers for extra protection. It  is very light and has a modern look. I just noticed that sometimes It's not that fast in terms of pairing with my device but still in an acceptable speed. I got this at a discount in exchange of an honest review."
5,Great product fast shipping!!
4,"plug hub is a little fatter  , so it wont plug into one of my devices with a case , otherwise great"
5,They work üëçüèª
3,Nice
1,Don't buy &#34;Apple certified&#34; cables from Amazon.  This is my third attempt and none of them work.
1,"This amp honestly sucks I've had two of this same amp now, the first one burned my subwoofers than caught on fire itself, and this current one burned my subwoofers that have a higher Wattage than the amp can produce and the bass level on the amp is set to its lowest setting, I just bought a new amp to replace this one and went back with Sony like I use to use before I had this amp the sound quality is much greater and a lot more clear still using the same subwoofers too the warranty on them replaced them for me and the new amp I can set the bass level up higher without it damaging my subwoofers."
5,Product works great!
5,Great customer service. Everything as stated and no problems.
2,Seller was great.  But the product is cheaply made and isn't what I expected.
4,"I'm not a sound buff, but this thing gets great range. The bluetooth connects about 10-15 feet away. My issue with this is that there is no volume control. One would think that the + and - on the top are volume controls, but they are next and previous. Overall a great purchase, but there's room for improvement."
5,It fit perfectly to both the iPod and my arm. I could use the iPod controls over the plastic. I never used the sensor case so I can't comment on that.
4,"useful and convenient.<br /><br />sound is quite cool.  there is no sound particularly distorted.<br /><br />connecting speed pretty good. just... price is little high.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon."
5,Both ends of the cable feel snug when plugged in. Probably the best cable I have had for charging my devices it doesnt feel loose or feel like its going to break.
5,Got the cables using prime so I got them in 2 days. Cables are great quality and charge my apple devices greatly. Thank you!
5,"cute, and keeps my zen mp3 player from falling apart"
3,"Nice toy I really enjoyed it and I like it, I wish it could be more vibration movements.<br />I tried to buy another one but I can't find it."
4,hard to find Lightning cables that work for a long time. So far so good.
5,"Works perfectly! I used this cable and Techstream 10 on a Windows 10 64bit laptop on a 2015 Toyota Camry, 2004 Lexus IS300, 2007 Scion tC and everything worked fine. I did not use the software on the mini-cd as my laptop refused to read it, so I got the drivers and software online."
1,to cheaply made written in chinese not worth it
5,Good
5,Excellent starter radio
1,"I wanted to love these sunglasses. They were a perfect fit for my face and looked great. The lenses were indeed polarized and worked well for cutting sun glaze.<br /><br />However, after just 3 wears (one week from receiving them), a screw fell out leaving my glasses broken.<br /><br />Obviously, at $10 I was not expecting these things to be indestructible, but to break after 3 wears is just unacceptable."
1,"Dont buy this product, dosent sound 24 hours not even 2 hours. They lie, missleading advertsing<br /><br /> Im on vacation birthday trip and this thing is a totally mess. i used to be a bose user and I make tha change to a beoplay A2. Worst decistion I ever made."
2,"This is a very basic, difficult to control MP3 player. It seems fairly well made so I'll give them that. The firmware is awful. If you connect to a charger, there is no indication of whether the battery is low, full or even accepting a charge. I have no way of knowing whether the battery life is as long as claimed because it's impossible to know the charge level.<br /><br />It will not work with Audible.<br /><br />Because it's so clumsy, I just loaded it with basic music and let her go---there is no real control so my play list is everything on it. Ugh. But hey, I give a star for that.<br /><br />If this device had better (a lot better) firmware, they could have a real winner."
2,"Arrived broken. After a $90 installation fee, and a ruined DVD we had to externally hook a portabable player to the monitor for our 12 hour trip the next day. The funny thing is we received an email asking for feedback from the company but there was no way to contact them.  But hey, the screen was clear."
5,it works - love my nook
5,Awesome  I Loved It
1,Received product with a defects be charge port
5,"These charge super fast, which is exactly what I was hoping for!"
5,Works great
1,This was a awful product and and very bad customer service by seller
5,Fast delivery.  Product as expected.
5,Good
4,Works good and well made. Sound pretty good as well. Small enough to carry around. I purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
2,Unfortunately not compatible with my older computer.
1,Did not realize that the iPod is reconditioned.  Considering returning the item.
1,did not work for me
4,Love it works great! It was easy to set up.
5,I love it &#60;3 though It's a bit expensive for this much small thing.
5,great deal on a hidden antenna
3,"It has a human voice warning that give distance in centimeters. No buzzer or beep sound, just the human voice warning."
5,"It look nice, love it!"
4,My wife like to see tv at night. With this I sleep well.
5,Shipping was much faster than I had anticipated. It seemed like I blinked and it was in my mailbox. As for the wire itself most definitely with money. I actually used this wire on a amp that had much smaller screws for the ground and positive. The kit did come with one 0 to screw clamp but could've used 2. Not complaining just saying.
1,"These are junk.  Not a single one worked in the package.  I tried to return and they refused, offered to send me more.  No thanks."
3,"Works, but it's flimsy. I would have liked to see metal mounting brackets, even if it raised the price. It looks good in the car and fits perfectly, but if I push on it, I can move it. I had it professionally installed too. All in all, good product for the price, but could easily be better."
5,"Love my purple Nook cover! Very sturdy, well made. It is a little heavy to hold while reading in bed but great for reading at my desk or on my lap. Great price also."
5,Good product.
1,It did not work.
5,"Bought these after loosing my keys at home, almost had to have the car towed and rekeyed. Haven't lost my keys since I bought this. Even put one in my wallet."
5,Works perfect!
1,The neck broke in 3 months.
5,Great under counter lights
1,"The first time I ordered this Ipod, it came without instructions, which was not too big of a problem; however, the Ipod would not turn on, even after charging. I ordered a replacement, and the same issue occurred. I did not care about receiving the &#34;retail&#34; packaging, and it appeared that it might be worth the small savings to order this product, but to no avail. Neither of the two Ipods received were able to be turned on...screen just remained blank, even after charging. Sorry to have to return this product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012C5XYHQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00"
5,"As described, I have yet to be able to use most of them but the one I needed does connect."
5,"With the headphones (Sony), this one is great!  (Instrumentals are clear.  I can hear each and every instrument in the background; and the lyrics are very audible and clear.  Enjoy it very much."
4,"Can't go wrong with the price.  Loud enough to fill a room with sound with just two speakers connected.  If some music appear low in sound, it is most likely how it was recorded. i.e. low volume or low bit rate.  Some mp3's are better quality than others depending on copy.  Equalizing automatic sound levels throughout various albums would ensure same levels.  Non of this has to do with AMP quality or output but more with music being used and how it was ripped.  LOVE THE LITTLE AMP.  One thing that would be nice is a headphone jack which is not available.  Damn!"
5,perfect
1,"Remote was delivered promptly but after opening package and installing new batteries, the remote wouldn't work."
5,Awesome aupwr fast shipping and packing superior selling i would recommend to anyone thanks will buy again in future
5,Perfect for my needs. Plays beautifully.  Great price. Great service.
5,good cords
5,"Little smaller than I thought, but the sound is louder than I expected!"
5,good value
5,Very cheap way to add Bluetooth audio to your car
2,"Not user friendly. Dorky touch screen. Click, click, click. Much prefer my Garmin. Sorry I wasted my money. I had planned to return it, but with a sudden move from one motorhome to the next, the packaging and receipt was accidentally tossed."
5,great product! worked great!
4,Its just as I expected it to be
3,It was protective but after a while it started to stretch out and didn't fit my phone that much.
5,"Let me start off, with the price.<br />For $10, this is such a great product, I would rather have this than a typical $50 mobile speaker. How mobile it is, and how loud it is. It's loud enough for my friends and I to just tune to some music while playing games, or whatever.<br />The thing is, distance, since this is my first blue tooth device I've had I don't know if this is normal, but if I walk out of  the room, it stops, and cracks up, or when I block it with my body from my phone.<br />Honestly, it's the price, I'd rather by 5 of these then one upper end speaker. Quality is great and base is heavy.<br />Love every bit of it."
5,these sound great....
5,Great CD player. Initially planned on using the Bluetooth with my iPhone. Found it much easier to us the USB port with a tiny usb memory card to store my music. Sound quality is tremendously better with the usb vs. Bluetooth. Overall very happy with this purchase.
5,very good
5,"Honestly, these are the only charging cables I've had that have not frayed or stopped working after a short period of time. I keep one next to my bed and the other plugged into my computer at work for charging my phone. Both get used daily and I've had them for over a year at this point. Fantastic quality!"
5,Great speaker with excellent sound for its size!
3,When I received the item it was not running. Waited about a week and it started running. This morning had it on and the pin dropped out of the socket. It was very inexpensive but also very disappointed. Will not order any more!
5,They work as expected! Much better than any of the other cables for the iPhone I have bought on Amazon.
4,"Great, rich sound. Battery life is a little disappointing but overall, I think it's a good buy."
5,"This little speaker packs a punch! I am very please with the sound quality and it has great bass for such a small device. The rubber finish feels great, too. I previously ordered SoundPal F2 Bluetooth Speaker (about $15 cheaper) and was greatly dissatisfied. This speaker is amazing and I definitely recommend. Great product and great deal!"
5,COOOOOOL. I love the color stripes put upon the black straps! FUN FUN FUN moods to change for day by day! KEWL!!!
5,"Met expectations, shipping time was awesome"
1,"lifetime maps??????Phooey, just try to get them....every where you look, they have their hand out wanting you to PAY FOR AN UPGRADE"
5,Works great! Thanks!
5,"This is such a good idea, a flashlight that happens to have a battery to charge electronic devices. At only $8, that's the price of a decent flashlight. This battery has a nice bright, easy to use flashlight. And then add that you can charge an electronic device - an iPhone 6 plus around a half charge. The battery charges via microUSB. You'll have to provide the AC adapter or computer port."
5,"I thought that waterproof was a blatant lie. I'll admit it! I was worried about it, and wouldn't believe it for the longest time. However, curiosity finally got the best of me, since I wanted to swim for long periods of time, and I bought this one. I was certainly not disappointed. It works, it's always been waterproofed to me, and I've never had to worry about it getting wet, or it suddenly not working. When paired with a set of waterproof headphones, this iPod is unstoppable. Perfect for showers and swimming!"
5,It's very nice I love it so much.<br />I recommend this fish finder from this store.<br />Sure I will buy more.<br />Thanks for you my friend.
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do and reaches far while doing it. Win.
4,"Bought as a gift for my brother, he uses it every night."
5,Just what I needed!
1,Stops working after a couple of months.
1,Not even the harness fit and it suppose to be plug and play.
5,"I've been using this case on my iPhone 6 plus for a few weeks and I love it. I get about 1.5 charges (on average) from the battery so I can go about 3 days before I need to recharge. It also fits my phone perfectly. I've dropped it a couple times by mistake and the case has held up fine. No damage at all. I also appreciate that you can remove your phone from the case without tools and it does take some force to unsnap the front as it should. With some other cases, the front cover is too easily removed and sometimes would fall off when the phone was dropped. This case doesn't have that problem. I do want to mention that I received this product in exchange for this honest, truthful and unbiased review of the product on Amazon. My review has not influenced by the fact that the product was provided at a discounted cost or in other cases was provided for free. I have no other connection to the seller."
5,Works perfect with iphone6 no issues.
1,"Wrong sizing, didn't fit my mk4 model key very well.<br />Guess it could just be the certain fob I have."
1,loses charge very very fast just listening to the radio for one hour
5,Great Value!
5,c
5,Works great.
1,"Product has no directions, the outside of the box has poorly printed outlines of Visor and writing in Chinese. Had to return, could not assemble and fit on the GPS in my Elantra. I was looking forward to a Visor like this, the glare on my GPS is awful. Guess the search goes on for another."
5,Has great sound was very impressed love this speaker
5,"great coverage for my reader, stay close magnetic closure turns it off.  slim design that is not too bulky to hold when reading"
3,The sound quality was good
5,My granddaughter loves the polka dots on her I pods!  She can interchange them to different colors daily!
5,"I bought the S-8 model for this product and I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound - especially the bass performance - for such a small set of speakers. I use it as a drone sound (taanpura) for my Indian classical vocal practice with an apple store app and it feels great! The sound absolutely fills up a small room easily...The only two possible improvements I wish for are 1) an ability to connect to another device by automatically disconnecting the previously connected one (this needs to be done manually for now) and 2) perhaps an ability to connect to two or three such speakers from a single device so that different tracks could be played on different speakers! Those two will make this a dream-come-true for me!<br /><br />I love the fact that it can be also used in the car essentially as a hands free system to receive calls (and I haven't tried but could be perhaps used with Siri/Google to make calls by talking into it) !<br /><br />The buying experience was also smooth & pleasant. It came in an absolutely beautiful box with a modern design - one wonders how many things Steve Jobs passion for good design has inspired!  BTW, I Love the rubberized top & bottom, too!"
1,"Poor Function and Poor Quality.  I have a different Dash Cam that folds up the screen. This one does not fold, so at night, the screen lights everything up.. when you park your car at night and forget to unplug or turn off, it lights up the inside of the car and can be seen for blocks telling all thieves to come and get it !!  Also.. The screen that lights everything up at night gets dark spots. More and more of them.. When the car gets hot from being parked, the screen is worthless !!  At least at night it cools off and gets bright for all the thieves..  It is not that where I live there are lots of them, but when you go downtown or other places and park your car, why send it up the flag pole that you have a electronic device in your car !!  Heck.. Thieves would not know at a glance I only paid 20 bucks for this thing !! Heck the window they break to get it cost more !!!  Also.. The Suction device grabs the glass well, but the slider part that hooks to the actual Dash cam slides off around hard turns and the Dash Cam lands in your lap !!  I guess you could somehow reverse it so it lands in your girlfriends lap and you could then have an excuse for being grabby..  Not sure.. But worth a try..."
4,"Very nice sound, good volume, good battery life."
1,"THE CABLE TO MANAGE THE SPEKER IS TO SHORT, IS VERY DIFICULT TL HANDLE.<br />I BEEN ASKED THE SUPPLIER INFORMATION IN ORDER TO REPLACE IT. NEVER ANSWER"
2,Constantly looses connection.  Would not buy again.
5,Okay so i've used a lot of cables and my girlfriend actually steals mine because how great these are for iphones. Some cords that i've had usually aren't compatible with my iphone and tells me i can't use it but these ones are perfect the perfect length as well! Not made out of cheap materials so i would definitely recommend this to anyone! :)
2,Package only came with 1 cable when it said 2.
5,"Worked out perfectly to replace my broken mount ,very sturdy product and it also came with the plug to keep from throwing a rooster tail"
4,It 's working very good so far. However I like it a lot. Thank you for selling this.
4,Not as loud as I had hoped for.
1,"I was greatly disappointed by the lackluster sound quality and volume level of this device. The design is nice but the volume control seems to have issues, as my &#34;volume up&#34; button didn't seem to work. Returning the item. I do not recommend. I replaced this speaker with the Sentey Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 for $15 more and I am blown away by the difference between the products. SoundPal is a waste of money and I definitely recommend spending the extra $15 for the Sentey speaker!"
5,This is second unit I have purchased. Super sound. Very long play time once charged. Easy to take anywhere. Highly recommend.
5,"The best non-Apple charging cords I've ever used. They are study, reliable, and I've never received the error message that the cord is not compatible. The best feature is the length of the cord at 6 ft. I believe most of my Apple cords have been ruined because of stretching and the cord ends up loosening up the wire until the constant dreaded &#34;charge, no charge, charge, no charge.&#34; I just order a couple of more cords to have on hand because our only issue now is losing cords. I highly recommend for those looking for a longer and less expensive alternative to the Apple branded charging cords."
5,good
5,thank you
5,Awesome
5,just like u said the product would be...thanks
5,I like that my device clicks into place giving it more security.. Nice pad for added function and comfort
5,"Wow! What a terrific fix for my sun visor problem. Easy to follow instructions.... a video to show you step by step... and it works!!  My visor had such basically flopped down and I had to remove it so I could see. when I saw the damage inside of it, I was sick. Of course, our friends at the Toyota dealership were talking 100 plus dollars. So I was estatic when I found the Camry Visor Repair kit. Worked just as they said it would and looks great.... even my pathetic stitching looks good!  Thanks for saving me money and making it so simple."
4,"So far this product is working wonderfully. I purchased the 6 ft cord so that I can use it on the couch and in bed, it works great. I love it, very happy with my purchase."
1,Terrible product do not recommend for a 2006 Honda CR-V. Nothing but the face cover worked. Had to use factory side mounts.
5,Great!
3,"I have used several of these mini speakers.<br /><br />This one sounded the same as much more expensive versions.<br /><br />The one issue was the button cover was on the wrong side, it was easy enough to switch, but the buttons are on one side only so not sure how that was missed.<br /><br />It does not come with instructions, and the buttons only show one function, such as there is no + or - for volume. but if you hold a button down it adjust the volume."
4,"I was hoping I could program the key for our 2010 Camry v6 xle using the YouTube instructions for camrys up to 2010. (Old key in/out ignition, door open/close so many times etc) would not work. Home Depot cut the key, that works , so using as hidden key to get in car only"
4,"good price, love it"
5,"Not sure yet how to change the language to english if there is an option to do so, but works well."
5,This is the best mp3 n mp4 player I've had yet...Crystal clear music videos are awesome great item
5,shipping took way too long but the product is excellent
4,Doesn't really glow but it's okay
4,Question...can I buy 4 of these and hook them together (wirelessly) for an even bigger outdoor sound?
5,Inexpensive and works!
5,"This product along with the power bank are a must have. When you are away from an outlet to charge up your speaker and other devices , the power bank is a life saver. I am completely satisfied with both. The speaker is small and compact with high volume, along with great ease to connect with your phone and computer."
4,"Every one who sees them ask where I got them. The mount is a little flimsy though, I had to mount them without it. I had to add about a foot of wire to 2 of the wires to make the work."
5,"Came faster then I thought, perfect condition easy to install. Overall perfect night was just what I wanted/needed"
3,"I love the color, but it has been a little hard to work with it.  It says you can use the side volume buttons for volume, but not while the song is playing.  To just adjust the volume while it's playing it will instead fast-forward in the song.  I haven't been able how to get it to not do that and just do the volume......"
5,Works well. Fast delivery
4,"Works well so far. No error messages from Apple and good, durable quality. The proof will be if this continues in the coming weeks. If so, will definitely switch from short apple cords to these!"
5,Works great!
5,"Great purchase.  The audio is excellent and the mic picks up everything very clearly.  Volume adjustment on the headset is a big bonus.  Ear pads and headband are both comfortable.  The headband adjustments are easy to use and seem to be durable.  The best thing about it is that I put it on before takeoff and I don't think about it again at all until I unplug it after shutdown.  No hotspots, nothing slips or moves, and the mic stays right where you put it. I haven't used the aux jack yet.  I'd absolutely buy from Rugged again."
4,Seems to have done the trick.
3,excelent!! fits perfectrly for my santa fe 2010
5,Works great. Exactly what i was wanting.
1,"I have a similar armband for the LG G3 from HandHeldItems and it seemed decent when I bought it but now - about 10 months down the line - it is falling apart and for some strange reason the touchscreen on my phone doesn't work any more. After getting in touch with them, they refused to stand by their product. Looks like it's $10 down the drain. I'd steer clear of HHI if I were you."
5,"BaoFeng makes great affordable products which last for long time.This is a great two way radio by BaoFeng. It is made with high quality materials. I love the fact the the radio is light weight and has a great grip. It is not heavy like Motorols that i used in past. My uncle owns a parking lot so it was always a great problem for them to communicate with employees. Since they got this BaoFeng radio communication has become so much better.Below are few facts and things that i like about these Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.<br /><br />-  When you turn the device on, a voice says &#34;Power On&#34; and then speaks the channel number. As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio. Below are few pictures of the radio that i took when i first received them."
5,Fits my GPS and is exactly what I needed. Very pleased.
5,"Holds my Kindle well, easy access to buttons and charge port. Looks GREAT !!!"
1,It didn't work  for Toyota Corollain
4,"Got the key a day before it was scheduled to arrive.  Would get a five if it came with the screw.  Had to use one form an old remote I had.  After two weeks of use, screw got loose and wouldn't tighten anymore but still stays in place since it snaps on."
5,Bought these for my son's Apple Iphone 6 - he digs the extra long cording - easier to plug in and use...no issues with charging...I would buy again if need be.
2,Transmit audio level is extremely low.  Receiver works well but again transmit audio is so low that I need to mention it twice in this review and yes I did try both wide and narrow modes in the programming
5,Can't beat it for the price
2,Got my speaker yesterday and was very impressed with the speaker at first. It's sturdy and appears to be well constructed. I took it to work with me and it played fine. Everyone was impressed. I tried to use it last night and again this morning with no luck. It just sits as if maybe it's frozen or something. When I turn the power button off the light stays green. At this time the only thing I can use this for is a paper weight or desk ornament. I have a GEARHEAD Bluetooth speaker that I had been using before deciding to buy this one. It's not as heavy but plays just as loud and works every time. I'll contact the manufacturer to see if it is a software problem that can be remedied or something. I desperately want this to work but if not then I'm fine with getting my money back purchasing a second GEARHEAD.
5,"This device works as expected.  Its hard to get real excited about a thing that is meant to be used when you are irritated and looking for missing keys.... but it does work...  The remote is small-- like the size of an Ipod nano, so don't lose it or you will need one of these for it as well..."
5,love this speaker
4,"Speakers work great, my son loves them."
5,"If you are looking for something just to replace those worn out factory speakers, these work great. They sound good and work great with factory or after market radio. If you want that high end sound, these are not the ones to buy."
5,Excellent
5,Great specker Im going to order another one.
4,High quality unit.<br />I have had a problem pairing it with my iphone. It may well be my lack of expertise and not the receiver.<br />I plan to seek technical assistance to remedy the situation.
5,Awesome
5,"excellent product, just what I needed for the Atlantic coast and Gulf coast"
5,Not the best but it absolutely does the job. You'll love it. Especially when nobody believes you. You have the evidence you need.
5,"Great board, easy to work with. Flash NodeMCU on it and you will be so much happier than trying to control it via serial with an Arduino"
4,"So far so good. My husband loves it. Plus it arrived really quick. Thank you, Amazon"
1,Works like crap.
5,Great product.  Very loud.
5,good price. promptly received..
5,"Fits the radio snugly, has a clip on the back for your belt.  I'm not sure how much damage and wear it will take - but it suites my needs."
3,Good overall product but could use a bit more flexibility to allow for better angle on the phone. Should also have a built in cigarrette lighter plug to allow additional flexibility in charging.
1,it did not work
3,This device makes it quick to take the soundlink with you because you do not have to disconnect the power plug. I gave this 3 stars because it is too easy to disconnect the power to the soundlink by slightly impacting the unit.
5,"Good performance card, with looks"
5,"My 12 year old son loves them. They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone. VERY COOL!"
3,"Seamless recording? I'm disappointed in this product because the results I receive are broken into about 2 min increments. For example I pass a truck on the highway. The first frame shows me behind it as the video ends. I start the next recording in sequence and I'm next to the cab of the vehicle. There is a time lapse of about 30-60 seconds. If something would happen during this time, it would not be collected on video. I find myself not having faith in the recordings since Im missing time. If im using it wrong please let me know and I'll be glad to change my rating."
5,Everything was perfect. I love it!
4,"installed one month ago, so far so good. black color is only thing i don't like."
4,Only worked for a week now can't turn up volume . Change review because company actually responded to review and speaker had a reset by turning volume down then back up and speaker has worked well since.  But if that is an issue then buyers should know about it.
5,"great product, great price"
2,returned them as they did not work well
5,very good product
5,"Our family has 3 iPhone 6 phones, and I now have 4 of these cords as extras. They work great!"
5,i loved it
4,"Ok but I wish it had a higher volume,"
5,"This thing has lasted through rain, Vegas heat, and kids..  Still works fine after a yr.."
5,Worked great
5,"Zero problems so far.  30' coax, feels sturdy, for ~$10 each, get an extra or two.  Excellent portability and stealth.  k2ncc in Oregon"
1,"The item I received was not as described.  It is not the newest model with the reverse charging capabilities.  In fact, I'm sure this is a fake Beats Pill.  The sound is not as loud or clear as the real one.  After 3 hours of charging it still wasn't fully charged.  The charging cord and auxiliary cord are of very poor quality and do not have the beats logo.  The weight is lighter than the real Beats.  If I knew I was purchasing a fake, I definitely would not have paid as much as I did.  DO NOT BUY!"
3,"Work good, a little short though."
5,"Cheap alternative replacement for the &#34;official&#34; AppleTV remote.  Works very well, and is somewhat more difficult to lose than the original remote."
1,"Terrible sound quality, and BlueTooth range was about two meters if that."
5,Good
4,WAS A GIFT
3,"I used this product for about two months before noticing that dirt was trapped between the case and the iPod which slowly but surely scratched the paint worse than I possibly could've done myself. I'm still giving it three stars though because there's a really good chance it was my fault. There were also a few instances where I dropped it and although the case would break apart, it did protect from the initial blow."
5,We rate the product as excellent in the capacity in which we use it.  We have had multiple Dakota alert  units on our property for many years and we plan to continue to use them.  The system protects our home and property from angles that otherwise we would not be able to monitor from our home.
5,Great product.  Great price.
1,"Cables worked initially for a couple days, then all three stopped charging our iPhones and IPad."
1,Received this unit 2015-06-18. Unit died 2015-07-14. Unfortunately I didn't notice until the return period was past. While it worked it worked well. I wouldn't recommend any E-Prance product until they fix their issues with quality.
5,Looks great and works great on my iPhone and iPad. Fast charging without the Apple incompatibility issues I've had with other chargers.
1,"Did not fit as expected,had to return it for a refund"
5,GREAT AND ON TIME
5,As expected. Very good produce.
1,Battery life SUCKS.
4,"Cool Radio.... the display is pretty small but so is the radio.  I am impressed with the hand held mic and the mount for it, it is comparable to motorola."
1,"This camera sucks. Just got it last wednesday and it does not work. Doesnt even turn on, the screen was scratched, and everything in the box was opened before I even recieved it. I want my money back."
5,worked perfectly when I brought them to the locksmith!!!
1,"It is my own fault I did not know it was for I pod, the connection was exactly what I needed for my Samson 49 but myI pad rejected it and rightly so .  so Now I must order one just like that for my I Pad, and my I Pad is not a 6.0"
2,Too hard for me to figure out how to use.
2,"difficult to use in every aspect. user interface, navigating menus, preparing playlists, etc. also does not really support mp4 as indicated. not that one could view a movie on the dot matrix style of screen anyway. suitable for loading a folder of songs for the day and finding play. delete them and load something new for the next day is the easiest way to make use of this."
5,Perfect!  Better construction than original and charges fast. Thank you.
5,"I really dislike the audio on my laptop, iPad, and phone.  I love listening to music and watching movies on all my devices and hate when I am washing dishes I could barely hear the movie or music playing.  So when I got the opportunity to review this item at a discount I was so excited.<br /><br />Upon receiving my item in the mail, I opened up my package and it came in the original package.  I connected to my phone wireless which was very easy.  I love it and  I can listen to my music or movie loud and clear. I love it!"
5,Excellent product.
3,Product only works in combo with extreme 3m mounting tape.
1,1. does not give the most direct route correctly even though it's programmed to just with latest updates. This is major a route i've driven for the past 20 plus years.<br />2.way too many in and out signal even when far from structures.<br />my 07 infiniti beats the avicu260 blindfolded<br />will not recommend
5,"Super Fast shipping, Item is as described, great transaction!! Thanks!!!"
5,"As advertised, great product."
5,"nice long cord and is a thick one too.  It is not going to get worn, twisted or break inside.  I keep one by my bed and another with me where ever I am."
1,"1 cord didn't even work when we got it, the other stopped working already.."
5,Great sound weather good out side use
5,"Very clear and great speakers! Not as loud as I expected, and slightly distorted when turned up high. But still are great. A great deal for the price!"
4,"Heavier and sturdier feel than the Apple cables. Great length options. It may charge slower than OEM chords, but I'm not complaining."
5,Ok
5,GoodÔºÅIt's loud.. the bluetooth works great‚Ä¶ good bargain!
5,"Used at the American Legion Delaware Baseball Tournament - worked 100%, batteries lasted all day, put them away for next year.<br /><br />OUtstanding product - and maybe next year I'll figure out all the extra bells and whistles!"
4,Good wire and connectors but the fuse is huge and bulky
5,It is very good item and I found it better than I expect<br />Thank you so match Amazon for this item
5,very good
1,Awful.  Not worth even buying  My passengers took them off.
1,"I've had this camera for less than one year and it has already stopped working. When I first got it I thought it was going to be a good investment due to the other reviews, but I found it to be an unreliable product."
2,"Cool but didn't work.<br /><br />It turned on, even controlled my phone fine. But it would not output any audio from the aux port. Not sure if it's a defective unit or if it just commonly doesn't work with my hardware (iPhone and Vw car) but I was disappointed none the less. Seems like it would be cool and easy to use if it worked."
2,"Instructions not included. Are they available on line? It's not working yet. Should the small light on the device light up? [Update: sound is weak when connected to an Android. I haven't connected it to anything else. It's cool for a DIY little project, but not professional quality.]"
5,Works perfect for 12.99 can't go wrong.
5,Working very good!
5,Good sounds easy to use
2,I'm having trouble getting antena signal[[ASIN:B00EPQPBOA Sirius Suction Cup Mount and Antenna with 8&#34; Cable]]
5,"Love this guy! I searched and searched and searched to find the perfect car mount. At last, I have. I am so glad I took a chance and got it."
5,Great sound! It can be quite loud if you're looking for that feature. Easy to set up and easy to use.
2,Didn't last for more than 6-8 months!  Great while it lasted!
1,Doesnt work. Tried multiple different iPods and nothing worked. Waste of money...
5,I love them. They charge super fast. I would definitely buy them again.
5,"I was skeptical at first since this speaker is so small, but it packs quite a punch in terms to volume and clarity<br /><br />All I had to do, was turn it on and connect to Bluetooth, it was already searching for a Bluetooth signal, no additional buttons to press on the speaker<br /><br />-Incredible range of over 40 Feet, it was at 50 feet before it started losing connection<br />-Includes carrying travel bag<br />-Bottom has a nice rubber grip so it won't slide off your desk or move around<br />-The blue light flashes when searching for Bluetooth signal and locks and stays solid blue once connected<br />-Loud clear sound that fills any room<br />-Battery lasted continuously playing for 7 hours and 55 minutes at medium to loud volume<br /><br />I took a couple phone calls using this speaker and it works great I could hear the other person very clearly and they could hear me clearly as well<br />The power button is on the back along with the volume control, the blue circle light means that it is on‚Ä¶ Orange/Red light means it is charging<br /><br />This does have an Auxiliary input if you prefer that rather than Bluetooth connection<br /><br />The bass is lacking, would be nice if it had deeper more powerful bass, but it‚Äôs more of a pop instead of a boom, which is acceptable for such a small speaker‚Ä¶<br /><br />Other than that this is a great speaker I definitely recommend it, for this size and price point, I can use us using this quite a bit or traveling with it since it's so compact<br /><br />I received this product for test and review purposes"
5,Grrat fast shipping great buy
5,Love it!!
5,Get error code for my Audi a6 2006
3,wifi does not stay on i have it mounted out the back of my vehicle i had wanted to connect to it from the front and get the pictures off but having to push the button for wifi i may as well just take it and hook it up to the computer other than that it was great
1,It charged it for hours and when i go to use it it last for about 5 minutes. I would love to return and get a refund
4,This is a good system and the company was good to work with when there was a shipping issue. The radio works and sounds great with th built in navigation software works awesome. I do have one issue with the unit. The radio continues to default to 87.8 and not the last station listened too. Can't get it figured out and have had no response on how to solve this issue. Anyone???
3,Worked good great deal
5,Although I haven't installed yet it looks like it will work.
1,Nearly incomprehensible manual. Not very usable.
5,This is a good monitor work perfect in my review camera i recomended for everyone..
5,good product
3,It's ok.  Not very loud. Wouldn't buy again
1,"Playback is distorted, and there is no counter."
1,"Don't believe the description 100%this product does hamper normal operation of your smart phone. While the steelie is great for holding your phone in the car it does prevent any phone with stylus &#34;draw on screen&#34; features from working. So if you have a phone with the draw on feature and want to continge to be able to use the feature, you need to buy an easily removed hard case to stick the steelie magnet to. This way if you want to draw on the screen you can remove the cover with steelie attached and scribble all you want."
5,sounds great
3,The box says that this should not get wet.  Is this actually waterproof?
5,It Was Delivered Fast And As They Described It
5,I love it
3,"Bluetooth doesn't work all the time , seems like I'm re syncing it every day to the same item"
5,Actually works
4,Works as stated
3,"Kind of frustrating at first, since there are no (English) instructions.  It works. Accepts drag-and-drop of music files from PC without any special software. Allows music to be organized into up to three playlists.  Not bad for the price.  Seems to want to start at the alphabetical begining of the playlist every time and go straight through, but there may be a way to change that that I just haven't figured out yet."
5,It is a pretty good product.<br />It is strongly recommended.
2,"When I first tried this speaker I was happy--<br />This speaker sounds darn good and links bluetooth to my IPAD with no trouble.<br />I soon found the &#34; NO TOUCH &#34; buttons to be a nuisance, There is NO feed back to know if you have activated the button or maybe your finger<br />did not register. A row of led's showing volume would let you know if your button press did anything.<br />I got used to this, I just kept pressing the up or down arrow until the volume changed.<br />It worked ok for about five days and then quit, the Bluetooth worked but no volume from the speakers.<br />For some reason after about a week of sitting on the charger, just before I was ready to send it back, the speaker started working.<br />I've used it for several weeks and it worked as expected.<br />Recently the darn thing would &#34; ARROW ADVANCE &#34; by passing my hand close to the button.<br />After about a week of this unintended advance to another Podcast , which often is not there &#34; and advance to nothing.continued<br />The forward button made it necessary to go to the other room and manually restart the podcast.<br />At first I thought it was my problem but after becoming more careful to not go to close to the &#34; NON TOUCH &#34; button it<br />continued to be a problem.<br /><br />The return time has expired and I will give it to my local Thrift store."
5,It is working fine on my 2001 and 2010 GM trucks over the last ~9 months (showing and resetting faults). I have not used it on other vehicles yet. It does not show ABS fault codes. A real good buy.
5,have been using liquid glass for over thirty years. for me its the best.
5,Fast charge. Not the cheap kind that takes forever to charge.
5,Excellent quality and perfect fit.
5,"I haven't used it on a trip yet ,but have tried it ,works great for the short distance I used it. Have  a smaller Garmin it works really well, have had it for about 12 years, still works great , just needed a bigger  screen."
5,"Thank you,  I received n enjoying every moment of it. Its small. But, am ok with it. Can u please tell, bow to get the lights to blink/flash."
5,"The instructions are very Chinglish ( translation from Chinese to English leaves much to be desired but of you follow the directions on u tube by an English man then it is much better) the camera works well and does what it is supposed to do, you can not ask for more."
2,"Wiring diagram on Amazon (nothing came with item) is for a 4 pin relay. Relay doesn't seat all the way into the socket, 1/4 in gap left open. If you can figure out the Chinese symbols it's probably ok."
1,It got cancelled.
3,"The control is not that easy to navigate. Tried to lower the volume was a task but itself. The graphics or menu is ver basic,not up to day.<br />Radio is so, so.<br />Bottom line is that it works but not 5 stars."
1,Bad product
4,Ill make sure to reorder this again
4,Works very well. Am enjoying it
5,One of the best chargers I've ever purchased
5,"Wanted something sleek yet effective and this baby does the trick. It fits the Pax like a glove and does a great job keeping your herb discrete. By great I mean you can put your nose up to it and not smell anything. Can't go wrong with this, just wish it was a little cheaper. Get one."
4,"I ordered this E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features. On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving."
1,"I want to first start out by saying that I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review of the product.  With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.  And it's all because of how poor the actual sound quality is.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this speaker."
4,"It's working not bad. But I think there is some problem with the battery, coz it's never fully charged according to the icon displayed on my iPhone status bar. So far no any other usage problem. Overall not bad."
1,Not waterproofüò° tried to contact seller to get a replacement but they never reply
1,"Terrible static, it has to be in certain distances to even be useful. The screws that hold the speaker together started to rust almost as soon as water touched them. Don't waste your money on this."
4,work great!
1,Rubbish. Battery failed after a few months.
1,Amplifies your voice but nothing at any distance. Save your money.
2,Received earlier than expected. But they are AA holders.  NOT AAA as advertised.  Guess I will return the AAA batteries I bought for AA. I saw this same problem on other holders advertised as AAA. Yet they will work fine in my application and supply greater amp-hours.
5,Fantastic cover for under $10! Excellent fit on the new nook glow light.
5,"Great price, great deal. Very pleased. I have purchased this brand in the past. Do not let the low price fool you. I have over 1 1/2 years of continued use. The product is quality. I recommend a purchase."
5,Daughter wanted this case for her iPod. She likes it :)
1,Junk
5,Perfect
5,Fits under the ps4 perfectly and continues the contours of the ps4.  The fan is quiet an keeps the ps4 so cool that the ps4 fan hardly turns on.
5,It arrived sooner then expected and it works great.
5,"Use it every time I go boating. Don't listen to people saying that you can use your cell phone to call for help - how good is your cell phone is the water? Be smart and get one of these, safety first !"
4,Good little product! Battery lifetime is kinda weak if you ask me!
2,This was cheaply made and did not last long
5,Works as expected.
3,The only problem I have with this radio is that I do not have radio codes (freq) for my local emergency management services. I thought I would be able to program this with either a cd or via usb cable. Not to happy other wise.
5,"Shipping was fast. Came two days early. Though refurbished came in looking brand new! Came in a box that was in a bigger box with bubble wrap. Speaker works great, easy to connect, came with all parts said in description. Tip: Charge before use. But other than that I could not ask for more for just $9.99!?!"
5,It works for what it is intended. It holds my unit and clips to my pack while I hike. Looks like it will last a long time. Not much else to say.
1,"tapes come out distorted after recording, wanted to throw this thru the wall, sony is just about as bad as GE"
1,"The giant failing of this set is its cheap and noisy tape deck.  Like other small walk-man like devices, there is a fair degree of inherent noise that cannot be blamed on the tape itself.  Hiss is expected; a DC or 60 cycle hum is not.  As we still have a regular tape deck in the house, I took the same noisy horrible tape that made me cringe on the ION device, and it played just fine on the normal tape deck.  My solution:  haul the tape deck upstairs and put this Ion set in the electronics recycle bin.  It fell far short of expectations.  Decent software doesn't make up for a lousy audio system.<br /><br />I hate to write bad reviews, but you should be warned this is not going to render results you enjoy."
5,great GPS. Easy to use and locks onto satellites quickly
1,"Do not waste your money !  Realizing that you really don't get too much for the cheap price, this radio was not even worth the $99. It seemed like a nicely built piece of equipment, but the performance of the receiver was really bad.  It measured very sensitive on the bench, but mobile operation was impossible.  Most signals would break up with some sort of low frequency &#34;motorboating&#34;.  Any time there was any mobile flutter on the signal, the audio would break up badly.  I tried to use it as a fixed station, but there were spurious blips and sputter that were traced to strong signals 16 Mhz away..  It was always breaking squelch and noisy. The microphone audio on transmit was horrible.  I went to return the radio, but found I had missed the deadline by 5 days, so now I have a $99 item for the trash barrel."
5,As described awesome product
5,Good quality
5,"Expensive, but worth the money. High fidelity, great sound from a small box."
5,Did everything I needed and then some
5,"Great for underwater, sounds good."
5,I was not expecting much out of this speaker for the price but when I plugged them in and tried them I was amazed. My dad is a stickler about speakers and even he was impressed. This little guy packs a powerful punch for the price and size and has all kinds of extras that you wouldn't find on other speakers at this price point. I ordered 2 at first and will be placing an order for 5 more.
5,Amazing product works and looks good
5,"This speaker is awesome. For what you pay, the quality is an incredible value. Sounds great up to the loudest volume"
1,WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!! THIS REVIEW IS YEARS OLD BUT RATHER POST THE TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY I SPENT
4,"Adorable cases, excellent value for the price.  The only complaint I have is that the sides are a little bit sharp where the plastic comes together.  Not a huge deal.  My daughter loves these!"
5,This little speaker is attractive looking and puts out decent volume for the size and price.
5,Works and arrived in a timely manner
2,"This was supposed to have two cameras--forward facing and rear facing. It does not, so it's getting returned. Disappointed."
5,"Looked all over for a good speaker.  This is it.  I got more than the 6 hours battery life out of it, closer to 8 hours.  Nice clear sound, with good bass for a little BT speaker"
5,Product arrived very quick & it was the easy to set up‚Ä¶just turned it on and my Bluetooth on my phone picked it up and it was set. It has great sound quality and goes very loud for such a small device! Great seller and great product!
5,Works well and it's been months! Affordable and usable.
4,Good quality strong case
5,Great quality and protection.
5,"After lots of searching, I bought one of these on eBay and I love it! It's well-made and solid, but also small and light, and also totally delivers on the air-tight seal. Great case for the Pax 2!"
5,"After having an issue with my garage door opener due to interference from LED lighting in the garage, this proved to largely solve the issue.  Placing these around the electrical wires between each light's transformer and the actual LED emitter itself stopped about 90% of my issues."
5,"Ordered from myrocki.com and surprised the product is so tiny! Easy set up for non-techies. Great way to use my Spotify account inside the house as opposed to on the go, with speakers that are 4+ years old. We use it almost every day."
4,It's short but did the job
4,Excellent
4,"They fit over my glasses. Can be prone to breaking if you are too rough with them, but I have not had any issues. They are easy to throw on in flight, and when you get to minimums you just flip them up and land the plane. Used them on my instrument checkride. No complaints other than they are kind of expensive. They do a good job blocking out the cockpit except for the panel."
5,As described.
4,"Would have been nice to get more terminal rings, it is accurate in the description 3 red 1 blue fork. This means I get enough red for the battery and the fuse and that's it... the ground wire? And maybe an extra or 2?"
5,Very rich sound
5,Just what I was looking for.  Didn't want to pay for the Onstar navigation system and wanted a big screen with mapping and turn by turn voice.
5,"Very simple to install and to use,  have 3 cameras hooked up on my dads F350 and he loves it."
4,too hard to charge - grandkids found it too complicated. I bought the ones with batteries and they like them much better.
5,"Product worked exactly as it was supposed to, good price, very effective tool. Sell shipped very promptly as well and the whole experiences was 100% on target. Allowed me to take care of two cars with no expensive trip to our mechanic."
4,"lots of foothills surround us here in Boulder, as well as gargantuan boulders, so have not been able to get any TV reception<br />as of yet-so do I sit on the peak of my house to accomplish this-PLEASE ADVISE-NO PICT<br /><br />  DAVID GAGNE<br />  303-499-8429"
5,Good universal tool.
1,"Only sent me one wire when I purchased 2. Doesn't connect to car USB, car charger, or my wall plug"
3,Would be great if the batteries would stay in the transponders.
2,"It really sucks, I should of bought another brand. It is very difficult to program.<br /> It just seems to want to go any other route than the one I preferred."
5,Works great very happy with purchase
5,finally a charger thats lasted me for a long time!
3,Music played really nicely but speakerphone option had way too much echo and poor sound quality transmission.
5,works great
5,Awesome!
1,Terrible!!  Chewed up the first tape I tried within a few seconds!  Figured maybe it was a bad tape - so tried another one - that I had also used before on other players - it also got chewed up within seconds!  I did not try further.  Customer Service says it's a new product - ship it back and they'll replace it.
5,Everything was great service shipping and product at a great price
5,Very impressive<br /><br />I am very rarely impressed with electronic gadgets which are not made by one of the big brand names. This is a rare exception. Beautiful and crisp sound coupled with sleek and compact design make this the perfect gadget for every home. I never knew what I was missing until I heard the beautiful sound this speaker produces. Easily worth $100. If you care about quality sound and design this is a must have.
3,"the purple one was okay for two weeks and then it wouldnt work unless you moved the phone a certain way and notifies you that its not compatible with the phone, the green one is good so far, but i know it will stop working anytime soon. still 8 dollars for three 10 ft chargers is ok"
5,Excellent business
5,fast shipping good product
5,Great case for my bluetooth speaker!
5,Very good
5,"Good speaker<br />Very portable, light, and loud! Very clear and high quality sound."
5,Works like a charm.
1,Terrible explanation on product and been trying to return for more than a week and haven't got an answer. Terrible return system
1,When I Drive my car the radio makes a lot of noise a lot of static when I stop the car the noise goes away I don't understand why
5,"Small speaker with a big sound.  The speaker is very portable, easily fits into the water bottle mesh compartment in my backpack and very light in weight, but solidly built too.  A great distinguishing feature on this speaker is that you can insert an SD card to play music from.  The ability to pair to your phone simply by tapping the phone to the speaker is ingenious.....LOVE THAT part."
5,Great...no complaints a year or more later.
1,"Don't work, is peace of shet"
5,Great quality and protection.
4,"Nice product, reasonable price, quick delivery."
5,Faster and good √≠tem
5,this is a great prodct and works very well.
5,great! love it :)
5,good option.
2,"Shipping was prompt, and got the unit ordred; however, does not work with 1998 model Ford F150 with OBDII as indicated in ad"
5,love it
5,Very nice and ship
5,"This speaker is really inexpensive and before I received it, I had my doubts about how good it would work and I was totally wrong! This speaker even works with my 4 year old smartphone, it worked with my Samsung Galaxy S4 and connects with out laptops and Ipad Mini super easily.  I am now also linking a Iphone 6 and it is so simple from any device.<br /><br />The volume that comes out of this little speaker box is tremendous and I don't say the word tremendous very often but that is exactly what it is! We took this on vacation with us and it didn't take up a whole lot of space, it was the perfect way to listen to music and connect with our different devices.  Great for listening to music on the beach on vacation.<br /><br />The rechargeable battery gives about 10 hours of playtime which I think is decent and the USB charger makes it really convenient!<br /><br />I use Skype a lot and the speaker is perfect for skype calls which means my whole family can talk to my relatives in the UK without having to sit around a computer.<br /><br />My favorite element of this speaker is the ease of use, it only has a few buttons making it super simple to use!<br /><br />I would recommend this product as a value for the price! I did receive a slight discount for honest feedback.  If you are in the market this product could work well for you!"
5,Came in on time as it says it is good buy
5,"This cable works great for charging my PS4 remote. I have this cable in the 6 foot length and it gives me enough cable so that I can still use the remote even while I'm charging it. Something I can't do with my shorter Micro USB cables. The end is a perfect fit too, and not loose at all. Works great!<br /><br />Sample provided for review"
4,"It could be a bit more powerful, but for the price, it's a great product and sounds decent."
2,"It works....sort of.  That's the only good thing I can say about it.  This is a very cheap MP3 player...in every way.  It's programming functions make no sense...you have to fight with it to get it to do what you want it to do.  I am quite tech savvy and it frustrates the heck out of me.  I actually bought it as a gift for my dad.  I thought he might like an MP3 player, but I didn't want to get an expensive one because I wasn't sure how much he would actually use it.  Fortunately I opened this one up to load some stuff for him and try it out a bit, but I'm not even sure I'm going to give it to him.  I'm 100% sure he will use it once and never pick it up again.  I would rate this thing as nothing more than a glorified flash drive.  If you want a MP3 player, do yourself a favor, pay 2-3x more and get a halfway decent one.  Seriously."
3,"This speaker can get pretty loud despite its small size and connects to Bluetooth quickly.<br />The Play/Pause button is not very sensitive and when pressed, there is sort of a significant lag between when it is pressed and when it actually pauses. The Volume Up/Down works well with no lag in between.<br />The battery life doesn't last as long as advertised (6 hours), it seems like it needs to be charged after 4 hours.<br />There should be a light or some other type of indicator to notify if this device is on/off. It would be too easy to leave these speakers on and coming back to it later without any batteries left in it"
5,"Finally a good looking , protective case for the gd's iPod"
5,"Great quality, like new!"
4,"Worked great, had to clean up a couple rough edges"
4,Is this good for a 500 watt jl audio amp
5,"Perfect case.  I love the colors, and it is very well made and fits perfectly.  The included stylus seems to work as well."
2,"I purchased this with the idea that I could carry it in my purse for emergency power when my cell is out.  I don't carry a big purse, so the size works.  However, there is not much power available for recharging.  Basically, it's enough to make a few, short phone calls, but that's it.  So it's more emergency, emergency than I really wanted, not even 1/8th recharge.  The other problem is that the button to turn on the flashlight is raised with no cover, and while in my purse while knocking around with other things, it turns on too easily and power is lost with the flashlight on.  I'm glad it was relatively inexpensive because it's not a huge loss, but I would not have bought it if I had known about these things."
1,"Just got back mine from I Com &#34;service&#34;. It has corroded and is &#34;not repairable&#34;, but has never been in rain or water of any kind. In 4 short years it has become junk, and never really had a very strong transmit signal. Even Icom apparently thinks it's garbage."
5,good deal!!!
5,"Received this kit, quite happy. No missing pins or parts"
5,"Bought two for an I phone 4S and 5.  Easy to set up, works fine.  Helpful when using navigation and audio book."
5,Buy it now<br />Fantastic! I am so glad for choosing this product. My adult kids love it too - also the price. Sound is much louder than what a phone can produce. Connection is easy. I highly recommend this product!
5,Easy to use.
5,GOOD
5,"Wow I love this thing. It came a day early on shipping. Very nice packaging. It has a soft touch rubber coating which I love the feel of. I tested it with a few different devices and they all connected almost instantly. I put it in the center of my house while i was doing some cleaning and left the phone in my pocket just to test the range, it never lost signal all around my house. Its a very loud little speaker as well, perfect for setting up outside when your having a barbecue or something. Its comes with a nice little carrying pouch you can put it in for traveling, it also comes with an AUX cable and a charging cable. Overall one my favorite products I've gotten in a while."
1,Bad instruction Lloyd like to return the dvd
5,Excellent unit! Paired together I now don't need a Mike cable with my TV productions.....
5,my husband love it.
5,Now I can download my own music via SD. I do not need to hook up my iPhone all the time for personal music. Great adapter for my GLK 350 benz.
5,"Beautiful and functional, a great gift!"
1,"Wanted to use it my I-home i9 so would have control straight from my pad to the speaker. Just did not work, with my i-pad or any other Bluetooth device. Would not buy"
4,"Works great for protection, Its worth the money but I thought it would be a little thicker."
5,Exactly what I was expecting high quality works great
4,Better than the last one.... dont trust the suction cup... works well
5,It is short but so far has been working good for over a few months.
1,Only the white wire will charge my iPhone 6
5,Excellent
5,Garmin nuvi 65lm has worked well for me. It has been accurate. The voice is clear and has better volume than my old 255. I like the 6 inch screen. I also like the fact that it doesn't tell you that it is recalculating which was really annoying. Lifetime maps is a big plus.
2,they lasted 2weeks and 3 days. now there in the trash!! You get what you pay for I guess.
1,I just got the kit today 8/20/15. And it blows. I am ordering a mother one from son where else. It is not 0 gauge at all the wire is only 8 gauge and the over coating is stupid thick. This is false advertisement and I advise anyone thinking of buying this not to. I recommend looking for green 0 gauge its the truth in its sale. I don't know the real name but look up green 0gauge and u will find it.
1,Don't buy these. I went through all three cords within a month. Seriously don't waste your money.
3,We have not used it yet. Will come in handy for training purposes it was a good price great packaging and comes with a microphone
4,Order was quick and came as expected. This is second time purchasing from this company. Only 1 thing that bothers me is that one of the cords shorted out and burnt my daughter's finger- I need to contact company about this since warranty should apply.
2,"Great device, but battery dies within 3 months"
5,"Great cables, made with quality materials, very pleased"
5,[[VIDEOID:88bac80b6ef4f7bc8264f121e325cb74]] I liked the E-prance dash cam so here's a little video review and instruction for it that I put together.
5,this cable very goooood~! I<br />low price high quality
1,"If you‚Äôre after the short, down and dirty version, here it is‚Ä¶<br />This program is a complete waste of time and energy.<br /><br />Now, for the actual review.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from ‚Äúsimple‚Äù as any software I‚Äôve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It‚Äôs ‚ÄúEZ Nav Route Wizard‚Äù is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it‚Äôs power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that‚Äôs their way of giving it to you.  However, I‚Äôm baffled by why, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after, you‚Äôre even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says ‚ÄúFly to Chicago‚Äù.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we‚Äôre just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don‚Äôt need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you‚Äôre looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard ‚Äì so much so that there‚Äôs no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren‚Äôt sure what order to put them in, or lets say you‚Äôre a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you‚Äôre trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop‚Äôs duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps‚Ä¶  make sure you‚Äôre in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you‚Äôd like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref‚Äôs button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let‚Äôs remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those ‚Äì they‚Äôre way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you‚Äôre probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn‚Äôt do a good job at ANY of them.  You‚Äôre options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I‚Äôm still looking.  If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn‚Äôt apparently in this software team‚Äôs vocabulary.  And if you‚Äôre looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I‚Äôve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I‚Äôve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke."
5,This really works great.  Could activate a signal from three floors down in my brownstone.  I had to get rid of them though because my 13 month old daughter managed to get the button battery out and those can be lethal if swallowed.
5,Was a good deck.
4,"Since I can no longer hear, the text messengers are Godsend. I burn through a LOT of dry erase markers, and I'm on the third whiteboard!<br /> NO MORE WHITEBOARDS!<br />The only reason I give it only a four, is the battery isn't field replaceable, and the battery doesn't run  all that long. But I love them already!"
5,Great cover for my Nook. Protects my reader while leaving all buttons accesible. Cant beat the price.
3,Easy to install but doesn't get best reception. Would recommend in an urban environment
1,"Made in China.  Unfortunately the instructions also came from China.<br /><br />Not only will you have to deal with the battery suddenly dying, you will also get little surprises, such as discovering the camera NEVER recorded a thing after driving with it turned on for days.  Why?  No one knows.<br /><br />Then you will have to deal with the so called manual that came with the camera.  If you can figure out some of these phrases, let me know because I have given up on this worthless three page manual:<br /><br />‚Äúselect 2/5/15 minute to decide how many time will be storage pre one section.‚Äù‚Ä¶and<br />‚ÄúDC5V input, please use the attached care charger. It have adaptor transfers to 5V already‚Äù‚Ä¶.and<br />‚ÄúDVR will restart after press Reset Hole gently by diameter less than 1mm column‚Äù‚Ä¶and there is much more.<br /><br />No, these are not typos by me, but rather what you can expect for this worthless manual.<br /><br />To make things worse, the camera is not intuitive whatsoever, so you are on your own to configure the settings.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  KEEP AWAY."
1,Will not work at all. Only gave it a star because it's required to review.
5,This is an awesome Bluetooth speaker. I originally looking for something can answer the call when I driving. Now I use this speaker everywhere! It has a great sound and great range! The charge lasts about 7-8 hours. I use this at backyard and my bathroom! I definitely recommend as a great gift!
3,although it says &#34;&#34;instructions at the bottom&#34;&#34; it does not explain how to charge it...it comes with  cables that i do not know what for....it does not say how to CHARGE IT!.....very dissapointed..somebody please HELP!!!
1,Key chain work great the fir 2 days 3 day it didn't turn on my truck automaticly and it doesn't unlock from far you literally need to me infront of door
5,"This is the best case you can buy for your Pax 2. It protects your device and is completely smell-proof while maintaining the small, pocket-friendly design of the Pax 2. It's very well made also, I have no concerns about this ever breaking even from a drop. I purchased this item on Ebay (same seller) and the shipping was prompt and the seller was friendly. Bottom line; if you want a smell-proof case to protect your Pax 2 while still being able to throw it in your pocket, you will not find a better case."
4,I wanted to install this unit myself  to see just how easy it is to install.. It is easy with good steps even for the novice but admittedly time consuming so if your not willing to take at least half a day on your project then your best shot is professional installation.. The four star doesn't reflect on the product but rather the detail you have to do in order to hide the wiring.. Doing it yourself will end up as a professional install if you take your time. I enjoyed every moment of it and received much applause of the finished product. Works as stated.. an enjoyable addition to our backup cam which now we can not only see but also hear thus saving strained eyes whenever we're backing up or parallel parking. A really good and needed security system. sample provided at discount for inspection purposes and an unbiased review.
5,Great
3,"Rattling noise inside camera, video works great"
5,"I bought one of these for myself and was so impressed, that I bought two more for friends.  There's always that brief lingering smell after the Pax is used, and this completely takes that out of the equation.  Also, this was made for Pax 2 and fits like a glove.  Do not buy if you have the original Pax.  This was purchased on ebay, but the experience with the seller couldn't have been better."
5,Excelente
5,works great
4,"If you have an older computer with a legacy bios this card will no longer be compatible because according to the manufacturer it no longer has dual bios support.  If you want a graphics upgrade, you'll first have to upgrade your mother board."
5,i use it when i need to charge my ps4 controller and no problems yet
5,Love this.  I have 3 of them.... one for all my shoes and got my husband one too
5,Great sound doesn't take up a lot of space
1,"Didn't notice that these were mirror finish, which is a useless and unattractive feature.  Discarded them."
1,"Didn't work for me, sound quality was poor, unfortunately have to return."
3,"These didn't last super long - after a few months, our phones stopped working with them. Prior to that, they started charging slower and slower. But they are so cheap that they still pretty much did what they needed to."
5,"Amazing speaker for the price, battery life lasts me a full week before recharges.  Update 1: Been almost six months and speaker works flawlessly, sounds as great as my coworkers speakers except at a tenth of the price."
3,"Sounds OK, but I was having trouble pairing my phone to receive and make calls. When someone called I could hear them but they couldn't hear me. The sound quality with the music wasn't what I was looking for. I sent this unit back."
3,Worked great for a while then got water in it and no longer works.
5,Very nice. Protected my screen from the attack of keys and other sharp things.
5,This was a perfect replacement for my original remote my dog chewed.
5,great cord! charges my wifes iphone 5 great!
5,I purchased this item on eBay.<br /><br />Perfect fit. Great protection<br /><br />It does cut down on the smell. I can keep my pax in my car or pockets without worry about the odor.
1,"This part sounded great on my music, but connection fell apart in a few weeks. Not very happy!"
5,Very sturdy and 6ft made a huge difference '
4,fit great.  finish is starting to come off. But still protects great.
5,Great cord! Fits a Lifeproof case perfectly(at least the 3 ft does!) Would be happy to buy again
1,Item pictured is not the G1WH. It's the G1W with the chrome front lens cover.  The G1WH (H stands for hidden) has a black lens cover. The G1W has 120 degrees field of view whereas the G1WH has 140.  Check with this vendor which one he is actually selling. I've bought enough of them to know the difference.
1,These worked great on several different iPhone6s for a week or two and then stopped working. There was no damage to either cable.  I cannot recommend these cables.
1,I purchase a BRAND NEW BOSE Speaker and i received an OPEN BOX USE one WTF? I could have gone to the bose store for this!!!!
2,"Just got them today and they work perfectly for charging, it arrived 2 days earlier than had originally been estimated so that was a pleasant surprise. Will update when this or the OE charging cable fails with comparisons. UPDATE 11/5/16: These cable have actually been failing more frequently on average than OE Lightning cables with less use even. I have the original lighting cable that came with my 6 in my work truck and it takes a beating, from being bent up sitting in the cup holder when I use my GPS and when I unplug it letting it hit the floor and drag all over the dirt, it still works perfectly. On the other hand, these iXCC cables by my night stand, only charging my phone for short periods before I go to bed, lasts on average about a month and a half or two months. Weird considering it doesn't get beat up or dragged around and isn't being constantly used like the other one. Definitely still a good price but I can actually justify buying the exorbitantly overpriced apple replacements with longevity in mind."
5,"Did not expect OEM product, and that is what I got.  Works great, fast shipping.  No problems at all.  GREAT PRICE!  Very happy."
4,It's fine. It arrived on time. It works.
1,It was not what I expected. You had to enter a full complete address. I ended up not being able to download movies or music. My kids use it to play games that were already downloaded. Honestly it was not worth buying!
4,I received a 2 pack of PL259 barrel connectors. however they are very good quality connectors
3,"I took very good care of this charger. It was never dropped, thrown, or spilled on. Despite careful treatment, device worked well only for the first 2-3 months but then suddenly stopped being able to charge anything. Device would not turn on any longer. From my experience, only reliable for short term use. I admit, it came in handy for my vacation. For the very low price, it's decent but definitely not a long-term investment so be aware."
3,Good but not for heavey dotey.
4,"right amount of blue tint, for day and night driving, however a little to wide, and sun visor will hit mirror."
2,price is right / wont last / pay for what u get / good picture while it lasts / had to send first one back
3,It's nice n small trying to get my music on it..comes with no charger or instructions on what does what.my friends out there this player comes with no charger no instructions n you also need to purchase a micro sd tf. card.or it will not play on a normal sd card...I did my homework they do not..happy buying
2,Not worth the price tag by any means. Get it for $50 or not at all.  I bought it on here and what I discovered when I opened  the box is a cheaply made camera with firmware issues.
5,Awesome cord!
5,Great product and easy transaction....Thanks
5,Good product
4,"Needed a professional to mount besides that very satisfied.  Heads up, sensor beeping.  Completely silent."
5,"The night recording is great, daytime is even better. I have no problems reviewing recordings and reading lic. plate numbers or other fine details. Works perfectly since I bought it in February, (its now August), even after leaving it mounted on the window all summer. The one minor issue I had just recently, is that the suction cup itself broke off the mount. Looks like the black plastic ring in the suction cup failed somehow and detached from the rest of mount, the camera itself is fine. Anyway I contacted E-Prance, they were very responsive, and will be sending me a new replacement mount.<br /><br />I had one issue, I brought it into the house, plugged it into my laptop, it powered up, but said there was a error reading the memory card (Samsung) so I tried another card, but same results, I emailed E-Prance, and got a reply the next day, but that morning I plugged it into the car, and noticed it worked fine. Again trying it on the laptop it didn't work, and I realized that I do occansionally have problems with my laptop not having enough power in the USB ports for newer devices, like my 10&#34; tablet. Works like a champ in the car, and plugged into the A/C usb for power, so if you have an older laptop be aware of that."
5,Great speaker especially for the value! It works better than our expensive speaker we bought a year ago.
5,Great product!
5,Recently purchased the same product on ebay. Could not ask for more from the product or the seller. Must have for any pax 2 owner!
5,"I can't say enough about how great this is.  Amazing sound, easy to pair, easy to use.  Worth every penny."
3,"Easy to load mp3s onto it. It basically acts like a flash drive. Fairly easy to move among the mp3s. I have two complaints. It's advertised as having an LCD display but it actually has only one LED. Of course, I saw that in the picture before buying so I knew what I was getting. The second complaint is there is no way to adjust volume when in FM mode. It may use whatever volume that was set in mp3 mode but I haven't played with it enough to confirm that. Even if it does, who wants to switch modes every time the volume needs adjusted?"
4,"I like it. However, for my 09 Camry, the signal isn't as strong any more. Many of the stations around town I used to enjoy are not clear like the old radio. I bought this in order to install the back up camera. For that purpose, it's excellent."
5,"Came fairly quickly, especially since it shipped from China. A much better replacement from my original key cover. Good price as well."
4,It works OK
3,"Good product, but the latch that prevents the rod holder from opening is difficult to operate.  The latch tab will break if you push to hard or hit or drop it.<br /><br />I just drilled a hole in the plastic latch and replaced the plastic tab with a 1&#34; bolt.  That makes it easy to operate and it will not break."
5,Works fine with my iPhone 5s
5,Works great!
5,"Product works wonderfully, allowing me to monitor neighbor's property when absent.  Communication between transceivers is excellent!"
4,Great Cover for the fob - better than others!
5,This little jewel is great. Be sure that you have a solid 5 Amp 12V power supply to hear its potential. I'm using it with a Bluetooth receiver and Dayton bookshelf speakers in my office and since I covered the annoying led lights with gaff tape I am very pleased with it.
5,The iXCC cable works great with my iPhone.  It is well made and very durable.  It is nice to have another iPhone cable without paying April's full price.
5,I take this speaker in my kayak.  It's is loud enough and the quality of sound is great for the price.  It lasts most the day.  Very happy with this little speaker.
5,excellent
4,"I own an iPhone 6 and it works perfectly.  I will post an update if anything goes wrong, which is why I gave it 4 stars"
5,Great item
1,If you want to cook an iphone
5,"Great quality, won't be breaking anytime in the future. Arrived a lot quicker than expected. Nothing bad about this product. Everything comes as described and is durable to last many many years into the future. It does come with a small booklet that explains how to use it for different functions. It was surprisingly helpful and easy to understand."
4,Work well withbatteries or your iPod or iPhone
5,"This is working very well.  So glad to find one that will work so well and especially for the price that I paid.  Received it very quickly, also."
2,didn't work on the nook
4,So far so good. This is my second TomTom. They are very easy to use.
1,Sent back<br />Did not get any reception from radio could only get two stations
5,Great Product
5,"Well designed, finished and packaged. I wanted a portable fold flat higher amperage unit to fit in laptop case and travel bags. Very happy with it."
1,"I bought this item primarily to have a radio to listen to while i work and listen to music i like. The item arrived quite quickly which was great however this is the only positive thing i can really say about this. I gave the MP3 player plenty of charge so it would last for around 6hours of constant use. I took the mp3 to work the next day and the device only worked for around two hours as the battery life had depleted. I immediately put this item on charge after use as i thought it might not have charged correctly, however after trying it the next day i powered up the device and straight away it turned itself off after a few moments. I have also noticed that the centre button is not working at all. Really disappointed with this item and i would highly recommend to anyone considering this as a purchase to look elsewhere and spend a little bit more cash or find another device as this item is really rubbish and really not worth wasting 20 dollars and now i have an item that no doesn't work."
5,"[[VIDEOID:a65fdadaac0fc343c28aa50c116b0677]]I have always wanted to have a rear camera for our car since I am a beginner in driving. I know how expensive it can get to have it added as a feature in your car if you are to go to a service center. Now my wish is granted, I have this camera in our car with decent price. If you are not inclined with wirings and stuff in the car it will be hard for you to install this. We installed it to where when you put the car in reverse, the monitor will turn on and this will give the view. My husband really likes this! It gives a good view at the back and keeps everyone safe when backing up. It works well at night too. If only I knew that putting a rear camera isn't that costly I would have done it long time ago. We haven't tested it under rainy condition since it hasn't been raining in California lately. But I will definitely give you an update after we tried that. I am so happy to be able to purchase this for a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
1,Not really working its falling just throw it out
5,Super happy with ease of use and quality sound.
5,Purchased 2 of these 1 for my motorcycle and 1 for my automobile which has a moch top. Just sat it in my dash speaker and everything works great.
3,instructions were poor and I still haven't got it to record my voice
1,Could not load music because was not recognized by computer. Tried on numerous computers and none of them would recognize the device no matter what was done.
5,"Perfect length, less clutter on my table, and no error messages when plugged in.  Awesome!"
5,"I bought one of these on eBay because I was going away on Vacation to Disney World and I didn't want my Pax to smell or get damaged in my luggage and this worked great! It was reasonably priced for giving me peace of mind that it wouldn't get damaged or have anyone smell my dry herb resin in my Pax2 (and I use mine a lot). I'm not saying it can trick a trained dog, but honestly if it got past the TSA in NY and Orlando International airport without being noticed on the X-ray or smelt, and survived how rugged they treat your checked luggage (literally throwing it on and off the plane) then I bet this can protect/hide it from anything. Highly recommended, especially for travel."
1,not great - does not really fit the larger phones. I have the LG G4 and can barely fit it in the pocket. really uncomfortable on wrist if I want to take my phone (& I have small wrists). I think it would be OK for if you have a smaller phone.
2,Two have Already broke
5,"I purchased this case on eBay.  Great product, works exactly as advertised and exceeds my expectations.  The case stops all odor and smells from escaping, it's waterproof as I tested this feature personally.  Very durable, good fit.  The latch works well, and seals the top O-ring very tight.  Everyone who sees the case loves it, very discrete and hardly adds any bulk to the pax itself.  I was worried the case may scratch the pax's finish, but after a month of use I don't see any wear or tear.  Very solid case, I would buy again or recommend to anyone with a Pax."
5,I have had these chargers for a while and they still work very well and have not broken . Love the product and a very good size ! Definitely recommend
5,great product worked beautiful.
5,Really good product!! Highly recommend these for anyone.
5,"Outstanding product as it's definitely a ALL-IN-ONE products with a LOT of features... it's a hands free device, it's a built-in MP3 player (MicroSD card), it's a USB car charger, it's a FM transmitter and it's a Bluetooth receiver. All that packed in a nice form factor with convenient controls and display. Honestly this is a great product if you are on the market of a FM driven product. Sound quality is good but it's still FM. Product sample received in exchange of an honest opinion."
5,Impressed! I've had these for months now with no issues at all.  I've rolled them up and traveled with them used and abused them in the car and so far so good.
5,"Works as expected. Matches the size for the original cable, so I don't have trouble plugging my phone in through my huge, water proof casing. I found most other chargers won't work with my case, but this does."
4,"This speaker is amazing! NFC, Bluetooth, aux, this speaker makes every possible connection possible. I had some family members help me evaluate this product, and some of the opinions I got were detailed sound, BOOMING BASS (thought of this one myself), and great build. The bass really is amazing, though, with the sound up high you can really feel the thud in the music when the low note hits. My sister even said she was thinking about buying one herself! On top of the device are play / pause, Volume Up and Volume Down buttons.<br /><br />Now the problem, which was pretty small, so I couldn't decide what to say here. The speaker automatically connects to the last paired device when turned on, and if you turn off the Bluetooth on a connected device, you have to restart the speaker to get the device back into pairing mode. I also compared this small issue with a Skullcandy Soundmine, which had the same problem. This is a small problem compared to the many connection methods, great design, and great sound quality.<br /><br />Adding this as an afterthought, the speaker is smaller than expected, but still just as loud."
4,"Good reception, easy to install."
3,"Easy setup (although I had to figure out the button controls by trial and error).  What I like is the clean installation.  What could use some improvement is the video quality.  Video with sufficient lighting is great, but low light conditions create hard to see images.  The other issue is that the video sometimes gets recorded choppy (like watching a movie reel that is off the wheel).  Not sure what is causing it, but it happens.  All-in-all, it serves the purpose of having documentation of things happening in front and behind my vehicle.  If you want clear video in any light conditions, you must spend the big bucks."
5,Great Product. Quick delivery.
2,night vision did not work. cheaply made
4,As advertised and within delivery time window.  Thanks
5,The device blocks hum caused when you connect a computer output to a sound board.  Does a great job.
5,Great product. Everything in the ad was included. Fast efficient delivery
4,Thanks.
5,They charge real fast the best part is they are very durable if I find some larger in length I will without a doubt buy them. Been through so many chargers and these are the only ones that have lasted and they have became as important to have as my phone
5,"Works great. My mother in-law uses this to transmit what she is watching on TV to her Bluetooth head phones. Occasionally have to reset by turning it off and then back on to refresh the connection, but it stays connected long enough for her to watch TV most of the night. I don't notice any delay, all in all its a great product!"
3,I sent back the 5M  because the mount included in my system was only a 2 axis mount and not the 3 axis mount as pictured and described.
4,"Works fine and has good sound quality for my shower where I use it, but I find the control panel frustrating.  Any time I try to raise or lower the volume I end up skipping places in the podcast I'm listing too."
5,So far so good! Fast shipping & good product. (Had them about 2 weeks & no problems). Thanks!
5,"Loved this item, small, easy to carry everywhere with me the size of a match box, helps me keep TV sound very low making people around me comfortable while I can hear the TV clearly and loud enough.  Was impressed with the first one and ordered one more.  The vendor also supplied the battery and headphones.  I am very satisfied and recommending it to all acquaintencies who suffer from hearing problems like me."
5,"I wanted to give this product a try after getting a repair quote from a local vendor that was nearly replacement price of the entire Ipod.<br /><br />There are two major things to know about this product.<br /><br />1. Replacing the screen is super simple<br />2. The ribbon wire is very delicate so go slow and steady and you will save a ton of money<br /><br />I have repaired 3 ipods using this product. The first time I screwed up and tore the ribbon wire, since then I can do it in a couple minutes and be up and running. Take your time and it will go very easily"
4,Just I love it
5,"It is the best charger. Dont buy more expensive stuff. This is the second time I am buying, and first one served me well over a year. I tried 2 other brands and returned them."
5,good
1,Stopped working after a month
2,"These feel heavy duty and I love the long length. With kids charging and playing at the same time I know ultimately they will break, but the price is right, and so far so good.<br /><br />Update:  ordered another set. Both had the pin connection part bend and fall out. Just with normal use. :("
4,"I am really pretty impressed with this deck, it arrived sooner than promised, was easy to install and sounds good. My only complaint is that when trying to scan through digital files the software will glitch requiring a hard reset."
5,"I own two of these, and use one for recording what goes on in my backyard for security. Very reliable. I forget all about it and it just works. I plug it into an uninterruptible power supply."
5,Was ablke to program my 2005 toyota corolla in just 2 mins. home depot will cut the key for freee
5,Cables work great! No issues. Great price too.
5,Very good video quality and easy to set up.
1,Worst product
4,Great product
5,nice battery holders. Work well.
1,"These keys have some cheap-ass plastic grips. The plastic was already separating. Then, when I took them to the automotive locksmith for cutting and programming, he said that there wasn't any transponder detected within the key.    Better off checking ebay. Found some on there for $12.50. Rubber grip. Higher quality."
4,very nice
5,A++ wires!!
5,"Really great product, the 10ft. cable is very convenient and it feels like a high quality cable. I've had for over a month now and unlike the one star reviews, mine has not spontaneously combusted, fallen apart, or stopped working. Just take care of your things and they'll take care of you too.<br />Also, the company's customer service is outstanding, having contacted me with a one year warranty and offering assistance if the product were to fail.<br />Will definitely recommend to my friends/family."
1,"Can't be charged from solar but very slow,I am charging it electrically than I use it .also very weak."
2,mine got condensation in it after the first rain.  the gps unit was fine but this had water in it for days before it dried
1,These are awful! They are very cheap and you get what you pay for... This package of 3 didn't even last a month and none of them work. Very disappointed in this product
2,The device was not what I expected.  Changing the functions were difficult.  The instructions were not clear on how to use the different features.
5,Great 8&#34; sub. Really fills my suburban with deep sounds. Fits right in factory opening for 8&#34; shallow sub.
5,great
5,What can you say?  It's a cable.  It works and appears well made.
5,Hhjj
5,Good
5,Perfect!  I mounted this to the dash of my 2010 Polaris 800 RZRs just to the left of the steering wheel.  Plenty of cable to reach the battery and be tucked away under the paneling.  Since the battery is mounted under the seat and on it's side attaching the battery tender can be a chore.  With this adapter it is quick and easy to hook up the CTEK tender to the RZR and walk away.  I love it.
5,"I'm extremely happy with this product. I've had it for a few months now, without issue."
5,"Had 2 for a few weeks now and so far, so good."
5,Ordered multiples of these months ago in case they break like every other iPhone charger and not one has broke nor does it have problems or show wear and tear
5,Exactly what we were looking for.
3,i like it  good for what i needed
1,"The unit always hang, difficult to start and actually this is not the product that I wanted but because the shipping cost to return this item is expensive, I had to just bear with the unit's poor performance."
4,Just as described. Shipping could not have been better.
5,"Great speakers. We do presentations and the laptop speakers sound tinny, with these speakers the sound is great and fills a large room."
5,Bought a couple of these and both perform flawlessly.
5,It worked in my HP Pavilion p6674y which has a 250 watt power supply.
3,Automatic  sensor it not working  correctly
5,It was a gift but I gave it a try for a week and it worked great and lovedo the size because it's discrete
5,This is a great antenna.  It is almost comparable to my J-pole.  I'm really blown away by it.
5,EMY Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter with Music Control Hands Free Calling and USB Charging Port for Smart Phone and MP3 MP4<br />This EMY works great but doesn't fit right in my car because of where my cigarette lighter plug is located.  I am still giving 5 stars because even though it doesn't fit right it works great.  It didn't create a buzzing noise some of the transmitter I have had did. I purchased at a discount for my honest unbiased review per the FTC.
1,Broke as soon as I tried to change it - definitely doesn't work.
3,"I've ordered 2 of them on official rocki web site. 1 of them died after 3 days.. Still no answer from the support after 1 week.<br />Otherwise the device is working fine for spotify connect. It is still a bit buggy, the initial setup is not straight forward and once the device did a reset to default setting by itself, I had to go through the buggy setup once again.."
1,"In the morning, I unplug this from the charging wire and stick it in the shower so I can listen to music while I get ready. Then I turn it off and go to work. While I'm there, the SoundPal detaches from my shower and goes out to its own job, working as a busy inner-city doctor. Then it donates some of its time volunteering at a soup kitchen. Then, it somehow finds the time to have an enriching social life and even date. At least, this is what I assume. It's the only possible reason that it could be completely drained of battery power when I turn it back on the next morning."
1,Kept popping fuses and finally gave up before I fried something else.<br />$10.00  just called it a loss.
5,"So I've had this little gadget for about 4 months and it works great. On long road trips I pair it to an iPad to play movies and the sound is directed to the car 's audio system making the trip much enjoyable and tolerable. Keep in mind that you have to find a vacant FM frequency in order to get a crisp clear transmission, so in cities like Los Angeles it may become a challenge but not impossible. Overall having bluetooth capability in my vehicle  it has enhanced my driving experience."
5,The ghost lights we're exactly as described above. They are definitely a attention grabber so if you have a chrysler / mopar then these are a great buy. Install was a breeze also
5,So far it works perfectly.
1,This player is junk.  The seller sent one out which did not work for very long and a replacement which did not work at all.<br />don't waste your time ordering this.  Both are going back at my expense.
2,Eh wasnt impressed very unappy with it
4,very good buy. They are of good quality
5,"If you're looking for some kind of high definition rear view camera then this is not going to be the product for you. I personally do not drive down the freeway or down the street in reverse so I only needed this camera for when I back up in a parking lot or parking in reverse which I do maybe 2 to 4 times a day and it usually takes me 5 seconds to 10 seconds max. I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review but would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera to serve it's purpose."
4,"Item came in decent time (3 weeks) from across the Pacific. Works, but not with the software it came with. I downloaded v9.30.002 and it worked great. The disc that came has techstream v10.00 and the FTDI drivers which installed fine, but the TIS Key generator does not work which is required for this version. Maybe my system is at fault, however I doubt it. Especially since v9.30.002 worked fine."
5,"Works with both iPad and mini.  Like the extra long cables, 6ft is perfect for working while charging."
5,Work perfectly and are more durable than other cables I have used. It has even resisted some wear from my cat chewing on it.
5,I've had these cords for a long time now and both still work well! Love the length for next to my bed or in the car
5,Perfect
1,The Cord does not work
5,Works as intended!
5,This cord works great to charge my iPhone!
5,works perfectly
5,One of the Cheapest case you can get for the Bose mini. Fits perfectly and all ports are accessible.
5,I have used this cable everyday for several weeks!  Not a single complaint!
4,Work great!  Very happy with the quality.
5,Works well and good quality!
5,Great quality. Best I've come across - equal or better than Apple's own charger.
4,Not sure how long it will hold up as it is a plastic carrier.
5,Very good
5,Good stuff
5,Great bulbs for instrument clusters.
5,"perfect fitting, hard plastic."
5,I have several sets.  No problems and each has worked as well as my original apple ones.
5,This is the best bluetooth speaker ever!!! It was easy to pair with my phone.  My boyfriend and I went to the beach shortly after receiving this and it was loud and the sound is clear. Best buy ever!
3,POWER SUPPLY STOPPED WORKING AFTER TWO WEEKS OF PURCHASE. NEED A REPLACEMENT POWER SUPPLY.
1,Received two of these. One fell apart right when opened. These are cheap and not worth the money.
1,They pop open when you hit bumps. Not good.
5,EMY 1080P Full HD 1920x1080 Car DVR Camcorder with Night Vision G Sensor 120¬∞ Wide Angle H.264 4x Zoom 2.7'' LCD<br />This dash cam is a great item to have in your car and on because it is small and compact.  The features of this dashcam are awesome and listed above.  The zoom and great video quality is a major plus for this dashcam. This EMY dash cam is easy to setup and get working.  I recommend this dash cam.  I purchased at a discount for my honest unbiased review per the FTC.
3,"I did not receive the manual or instructions how to connect it or how to use it, I though that the iPhone plug will work as an Audio controller but it is just a iPhone charger, about the sound I think that it needs more power and sometimes I get a little &#34;Beep&#34; in the radio saying &#34;CD ERROR&#34; but the music is still playing."
1,This case is the worst the packaging was great but when I opened it it had scratches and other things I don't know what their are but I don't recommend this case at all!
4,works well but the plastic cover of usb port slips out of it sometimes. It is a little annoying.
5,Works great
5,My items got here in a timely fashion. These are the best non-Apple chargers I've purchased. I keep one at home and keep the other with me throughout the day. Money well spent.
5,"Great sound from a little box, and what seems to me to be excellent battery life. The fact it is water-resistant means if it gets caught in a sudden Summer storm here in the South, it isn't destroyed."
1,doesnt work well
2,"the straps broke at the seam where it was attached to the bag, after only about a month"
4,Good quality just wish it had a clasp to keep it closed.
5,It is a perfect replacement for your Apple charging cord.  It works good with iphone 6 and Ipad.
5,great
2,"Very cute case that has a pattern that wraps around entirely. However, the case chips extremely easily. One drop and the case breaks off its corner, making it useless to protect a second drop there."
5,Exactly what I ordered at a very good price.
2,Failed in an application well below the rated power.  Poor design quality where reliability is concerned based on my experience.
1,"FALSE , DOSENT HAVE WALL CHARGER."
5,excellent product for price
5,Worked great..
3,"speakers are a little flimsy, but for the price, well worth it..."
4,Good product
4,"These are nice and sturdy, but they only work with my iPad Air and NOT with my iPhone 6"
4,expectations were met for this order.
1,"This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-("
5,It fits perfectly!  I want it in another color.
3,For the size and price its worth it. Volume is difficult to control but the sound is good.
4,Good for the price
5,"Great for the walkie talkie I purchased for my father.  He hates the clips on walkie talkies, because he wears a belt and any time he is bending over it digs into him or the item gets loose.  He lost a nice set prior on a fishing trip.  So, I purchased him new walkie talkies and these to keep the items in place and from lost.  It has a belt loop vs. a clip so harder to come off.  Also, the material is nice and thick, nicely made and durable."
5,Perfect just what I was looking for
3,"Im going to give this product a 3 star.<br />I'm going to start by saying that this budget head unit is pretty awesome for the money you spend. It is also partly my fault that I didn't do a little more research before purchasing the product.<br /><br />Pros<br />-The bluetooth connection is awesome. Gives you the ability to listen to pandora and any other music app through your phone. When I use the mic to talk on the phone through the car, people are amazed at the quality of my voice. Im glad that this unit is so clear.<br />-You can play DVD's.....<br /><br />That's as far as I can go with the standouts.<br /><br />The issue i have for this is that, I cant really imagine many people using the DVD feature anymore, considering DVD or any kind of CD device is outdated technology, especially if you have a smart phone that you are connecting to this device. I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys."
5,They work great!
4,"Got 3 of them, all work as advertised, when they finally go bad, I will recycle them. I use them at work."
1,Zero stars. Ordered 2. 1 worked for 45 minutes the other worked 2 days.  Junk
3,Received on time without issue for a great price.  Cables are very stiff.  Rolled them up for travel a few times now and found a few crimps in the sheathing after unrolling but they are still working fine.  My worry is that cables will develop on open circuit after a few months of use.  Time will tell.
5,"Worked as expected... and GREAT.  Easy to install, simple to use.  You just need a 1.5&#34; drill bit and a little bit of common sense."
5,Apple certified cables are the BEST.  Any others are inferior to the MFI certified ones.  Don't buy unless it says Apple MFI certified.
1,"&#34;This accessory may not be supported&#34;. This cable does not appear to be certified and does not work with my iPhone 6. I bought two of them based on the great reviews, but they do not work."
5,Fine fit and feel.
1,These were returned.  Did not like it.
5,We got this for our daughter's 2 year birthday party since monkeys are her favourite thing. I also plug it into my phone for her when Dada calls from work and she just smiles and laughs. We both really enjoy this talking monkey.
5,"A friend brought his to a BBQ we had and played music from his smart phone all day.  It was great but I didn't understand how it worked and couldn't really see a real use for it.  Then, as a gift, he bought my boyfriend one.  And showed me how it worked. I loved it so much I bought one for myself!  I use it with my laptop, my iphone, my ipad...it doesn't need to be plugged in (it charges when it is plugged into the laptop) and it was SOOOOO easy to connect.  I literally am the worst techy person (I don't have any music on my phone because I don't know how to get it on there!) and even I got the bluetooth to work.  I can listen to &#34;The Moth&#34; from my iphone or watch a movie on my laptop and actually hear what is going on.  I have other speakers that I bought through Amazon as well and I loved those.  But, what I like specifically about this is that it is bluetooth and it doesn't have to be plugged in. And the other speakers I can't use with my ipad or iphone.  I can actually listen to my iphone in the car.  And when my phone rings, it stops what I was listening to until I am done talking."
5,Basic mount.. light wieght...
2,It's not the convex mirror but will do I hope the other one I ordered 2 day ago come a convex one if not I WILL be returning that one
5,My fave thing ever!!! Fits perfectly :)
4,"Good customer service, quick to resolve product issues,  very helpful with returning product and quick to refund money.  Product was great quality just didn't work for my application."
5,Great charger
5,best case for my iPad
5,"The longer cords are great, makes using the phone and iPad a lot easier because sitting is not as limited."
5,"Purchased this Bluetooth Speaker for my daughter as a gift. We both love it, as well as all other Sentey products we have! Item is packaged really well to prevent damage, super fast shipping. Speaker itself is portable, a little heavier than others I've seen but not enough to be a hassle. It's made really well, I expect it will last quite awhile! Sound quality is amazing, I'd expect nothing less from Sentey!<br /><br />I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN."
5,"Excellent Cables, they work just as described and have been great!"
3,Okay for the price you pay
5,"Awesome amp!<br />I used:<br />- Kastar New LCD AC Adapter 12V 6A<br />- Audio Technica AT-LP60<br />- JBL Loft 40<br />Budget set up to play my records with decent sound :)<br /><br />Only thing i don't like with this are the lights, they're like christmas tree lights when it's on"
5,"I got this for my child. I was not expecting anything spectacular, but it was very easy to use and set up. The minute you turn it on it is searching for a bluetooth device (good thing) . It is actually loud. You can only play this via bluetooth. No other audio input jack."
5,So my brother digs them he hooked them up to his equipment.. He's into the whole DJ scene so our adds good vibes to the set!! Great birthday gift!!! I want some Bluetooth ones ^_^
5,Works great
5,Works great in my wife's little car. Installed myself.
5,"This antena works great it pick ups hd Radio reception, even when driving, hook this up to my aftermarket radio since I did not want to look for my built in antena from the car it was in the back to much trouble, just plug this in and FM radio, I would recommend A +++++++"
5,"I've acquired numerous cheap Bluetooth speakers as a kind of hobby--some of them clearly intended to look and function like a JBL Pulse or a Beats Pill or a Jambox.  Some lasted 3 days: none served me for more than a month before breaking.  And most cost at least twice as much as this gold all-metal BT speaker that looks like the interchangeable lens for an SLR camera.<br /><br />In short, this is the only non-brand, inexpensive BT speaker that I could recommend and that I might give as a gift.  The audio quality is loud enough and decent for a speaker of this size, and the speaker has proven durable, lasting me for an entire year.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few caveats: You should not expect to hear much bass (or, for that matter, anything close to full-frequency sound).  Also, any reference to an FM radio is unlikely to have any relevance in the West, where all you're likely to receive is static.  Finally, my &#34;pre-2014&#34; version of this speaker charges with a &#34;mini SD&#34; connector (commonly used to transfer images from a digital camera to computer) instead of the more common &#34;micro SD&#34; connector."
5,"Whenever I review an electronic, especially one dealing with audio output, people always wants to compare a high end unit to a value brand, when, in fact, its apples to oranges.I don't use my Infinity One portable speaker for the same sound output, situations, or locations as I do my JBL Charge 2. While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.<br /><br />Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:<br /><br />Yays:<br /><br />*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.<br /><br />*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)<br /><br />*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.<br /><br />*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.<br /><br />*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.<br /><br />*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.<br /><br />*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.<br /><br />*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.<br /><br />*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.<br /><br />*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.<br /><br />*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.<br /><br />*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.<br /><br />*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.<br /><br />*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.<br /><br />In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.for the value and clarity.

5,"Nice, listening to it as I write this"
1,I expected the volume to be much more than it is.  My small plug-in speakers are louder than the Keedox speaker.
5,"Great cord, very durable and last longer than original Apple cable."
5,Great quality! I was able to replace my cracked glass and frame of my iPod without a problem and it works great!!
5,Very nice. I put these 8n the back and some Pioneer 4 ways in the front. These add the right amount of bass that the 4 ways lack. I power these standard from the headunit....5o watts per channel 22 watts rms each channel. I don't have any distortion and enjoy my ride to work.<br /><br />These with the 4 ways can make you want to crawl out of the window when tuned well. I suggest the setup for anyone replacing stock and not wanting to drop more than $200 including the headunit.
1,"The one I received didn't work, I returned it."
4,Great for indoors or outdoors in the park.
4,Love this cover.  Very well made and protects the Nook.  Only odd thing was that my clasp is located at the back of the cover.
4,"Good product, but read carefully to make sure you get the correct length. The lower priced cables are shorter...which might be exactly what you want. But I didn't pay close attention to the length specified in the details. So the cables are only 15&#34; long, but they work great."
5,"Perfect, Fast charging, thick and durable."
5,Couldn't be more happy for the money spent
2,after 5 months it discolored and frayed on one end.... worked well until now.<br />Would like replacements. what do I need to do?
5,ok
5,"These cords are very well made, better than the original iPhone cords.  Extremely happy with my purchase."
5,It's brighter then I thought. I use it on my Ebike it was a little bit of a challenge to hook up but happy with results
5,awesome
5,I love
5,Easy to program works great
5,"I love this speaker.  For the price, it cannot be matched.  The sound delivered is great for tailgaiting and other outside events.  Some may not like the fact that there is no individual control for bass/treble, but I have not had a need for this.  The bass is a little heavy, but this is really only noticeable if you are right next to the speaker.  Battery life is incredible; I've run this for at least 6 hours while charging a phone and it still had juice in the tank."
5,Still looks great after a yr installed..
5,Great product!!  Arrived in a timely manner.
5,"When I started working at my store, I noticed that everyone had radios on. So, I wore my earpiece. I  tried theirs, couldn't hear a thing but this earpiece is loud and clear. More important is the fact that it is comfortable and fits my ear properly.<br /><br />I have bought the 1-wire and two wire versions from TAPaulK and will continue to do so. They work great and stand up to whatever you throw at them, even though my 2-wire one has a small gash in the wire on the bottom it still works. Buy one, heck, buy two!  You won't be disappointed."
5,works great and the price was nice!
5,Love it. It help very much to filter out the reflections on my windshield.
1,"The blutooth on mine won't work and when it does work, it disconnects itself, wasted my time and money on this, already working on returning it.<br /><br />On another note, I have a blutooth speaker from xsoundstar, and it works beautifully. Had it for about a year and still works wonderfully, highly recommend that instead."
1,Easily broke within 4 months of being on my key chain.
5,Excellent product. Have been using it for over a month now and they work as good as the original. The length of the cable is definitely a plus! Good but and will recommend.
1,"Ipad incessantly made a charging sound, one after the other.  I suspect this is apple putting software updates in to prevent use of other cables, but it made the cable unusable."
5,Thank You
2,"I ordered two, and one stopped working 2 months later while the other one continues to work."
2,This thing doesn't work very well at all.
4,"My mom is deaf.  Since her stroke, she speaks in a whisper.  It's been very frustrating for my sister and me not to be able to hear what she is saying.  This little gadget is making it possible to understand her.  It's small, so we can handle it easily.  It's definitely worth the money."
4,These cords are great!
5,A real bargain.  A bit of a tussle to attach to the mini Bose but well worth the effort!  Good shopping experience.
1,Broke after one week of use.  Both of them
5,Great product
1,Stopped working after a week- while it did work it would make my CD player say cd err on the screen about every 1-2 minutes and would cut out the audio playing
1,"After charging fully, This camera took one picture and hasnt turned back on.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated in opening and can not return.  I paid $27 for a pile of plastic.  Does not swivel well or fit right in mount either.  Picture quality is poor.  Will not purchase any products from company again and disappointed Amazon would even carry a product with no quality or funtionality."
5,Worked under water
1,"Does not function as advertised.<br />SIM card slot does not close properly.<br />Programming not straight forward or functional.<br />Sounded like a bargain, but was a waste of money and time"
5,Can't complain. .awesome ipod
5,"Product worked great, no issues, super easy to install if your model is listed you owe it to yourself to get this product."
1,Item received defective. No response from seller.
1,-1 star 1 not working 2 wrong description of the item 3 wrong connector 4 broke after 1 min of use ( got stock on the car connection and I had to break it to get it out) Yes that's right 5 save your $13
5,The case outlasted my Nook!!  Loved it
1,Having a lot of issues with the Sirius xm radio
5,"Amazing dash cam -- especially for under $30.  HOWEVER, please note that I originally purchased this with a 32Gb Ultra SanDisk, and it didn't work (it would only record a couple scenes then quit recording). I then tried using a 16Gb Extreme SanDisk, and it's been working perfectly."
1,Doesn't work like it said. Bluetooth doesn't work.
5,great cover
1,"Does not fit original key that came with SUV. I bought this to replace a broken cover, but the key I had does not fit."
3,Satisfied customer
2,"Keeps shutting down and re-powering up while driving, other than that, it is a good device, very functional for the price."
5,These pedals covers are a really nice upgrade and a great value! They add a very custom look to the edge sport! The rubber pads are very grippy so they will still work good in wet weather and last a long time! I used a high speed steel .156 dia drill bit.
5,"Great device, works as advertised, value priced. I'm glad I ordered mine and would highly recommend it to others."
1,Excesivamnete costoso
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. Installation went smooth and worked great, that is for a couple of weeks. Then it just decided to stop working, no rhyme or reason for it.  I unplugged it and plugged it back in, still nothing. So save your money and buy a different product!"
5,"These have been great, I have bought one for each of my kids.  I love having the micro SD slot to expand the storage."
5,Works great! Just as fast as the charging cord I got directly from Apple.
5,I got this product for a friend and we tried it out. The sound is amazing.
2,Poor reception. Waste of money.
5,Works great
5,perfect fit
5,A common and simple design.  The sound quality is really good (I use my favorite Philips earphones and didn't try the included ones).  I'll get a couple more as spares.
4,"fast shipping item is exact as picture item is about circumference  of a nickle and 4 1/4 inches long, flashlight is bright and it can completely charge phone 1 time....charger itself will take about 4 hr to completely to charge. it has a blue light indicating that its charging your phone and a red light indicating  that charge is charging...charger itself will not indicate low battery will just not turn on."
5,These work great much cheaper than Apple. Use them all time on different devices  I have several and have never got &#34;device not recognized &#34; arrived quickly with free shipping. I would highly recommend
5,The sound quality was amazing and comparing with the Bose color it was a great deal for the price.
5,"Amazing sound! Took a while for it to get  connected. But other than that, its a great little speaker. It's also loud!<br />Keep in mind, this thing can only be connected at one at a time. So connecting 2 won't work.<br />Bass is amazing too."
5,Cool
1,This cover was vinyl!
5,love the long cord just what I ordered
5,This is a great cover with a wonderful price. It took a lot of abuse before we ended up buying a survivor case for our 7 year old.
5,I listened to my neighbors $60 Bluetooth speaker and decided to find one online.  I settled on this Sentey and had a pleasant surprise on how great it sounds.  Blows my neighbors more expensive one away.  He just ordered one for himself and is giving his current one away when it arrives.
5,Great product
5,Works perfect on my elite 4
5,"These are quintessentially custom DVD players that have high-end OEM auto-manufacturers' specs that you can install to almost look like they came with the car.  The mounting systems on these players are one of the largest differences between them & lesser players; they are solid-cast metal harnesses with mobile, &#34;floating&#34; T-locks that do both a great job of supporting the player, allowing versatility and security in mounting the units to the headrest support poles.  Most other competitors for half the price have nylon band that you have to cinch down around the unit and headrest support poles that are a pain and tend to slouch over time.  Minimal cords (largely due to a single power cord & IR headphones not requiring any plug-ins) give it a clean appearance in a nice luxury sedan and increases the ease of my children getting out of the back seat exponentially.  Probably the most important aspect of this player is picture quality, which is outstanding; and I would relate to that of a Retina display on an iPad- very vivid and seems that they almost solved the sun glare problem.  They also do not show any signs of aging from being constantly installed in the car during the hot months of summer, only time will tell for the winter.  Finally, the biggest difference to us and a major reason for purchasing these units at a higher price, was the steady-state drive.  Those who are not familiar with this aspect may completely overlook this most-important characteristic that differentiates this player from other products; since this will be our third pair of rear entertainment players in five years, I can attest to the importance of this in terms of durability for those looking for this product to entertain young children.  The past two set of players (not solid-state) had front 'doors' that opened with a latch which always 'happened' to get broke off from certain someones trying to change a disc by themselves, while their loving parents were trying to keep the vehiclebetween the lines; and read the disc with a floating eye-reader, rather than a fixed eye from a uniform read point constantly.  Just for the durability factor, I will always opt for solid-state drive rather than door and floating eye reader; the solid-state players 'feed' the discs into a slot on the side or bottom.  Only time will tell to the durability of this, but my hypothesis should prove to be sound.  The only slight minus to a solid-state is that it seems to be much more finicky with reading scratched or smudged discs than floating-eyed readers; but then we just need to keep the DVDs in better shape, folks!"
4,It was a struggle to learn how to use it.
5,I love how easy this connects to my phone.  I use it every morning as I'm getting ready to going to my friend pool.
5,My daughter absolutely loved this case.
5,"Very cute. I feel like the phone is protected if I drop it (except for the screen, which it doesn't cover). I like how it feels in my pocket too."
5,I got mine from a local stereo shop for my new Kia K900. My stock system is a 17 speaker Lexicon by Harmon Kardon.  By far the best stock (or even aftermarket) stereo system I've ever used in a vehicle... the only thing I needed was a little more bass.  In comes JBL. I put two of these in a vented box and mounted the box and the amp in my huge trunk.   These subs are quite powerful. I've mated them to a dedicated 550 watt RMS PPI amp.  So far so good.
4,Looks and works great. Keeps fob from sliding around. Feels good in your hand.
5,Purchased for my husband and he is delighted with the product
1,"The posting did not mention that the product was only the cables and no plug ins. I ordered 6 of them, and two didn't work within the first week."
5,I love this stand.  What a relief on my neck when reading in bed.
4,"For the price nice looking, sturdy and the sound is slightly above average.  Good product."
5,Great product and sturdy craftsmanship.
5,OK
5,Works as expected and charges fast
1,"Worst product ever created.  Horrible construction.  You can tell you are dealing with junk the moment you take out of the box as supports are flimsy and not affixed correctly.  Very difficult to install relative to the two other pairs I installed in other cars from another brand.  Finally, when I did finally get the units installed, the screen on one died within a week.  Warranty is terrible and company doesn't respond to communication.  When I finally threatened to report to the state agency for consumer fraud, they replied and said their standard policy for warranties is to make customer pay for return shipping (customary) AND return postage (definitely NOT customary).  I would not recommend this product to even Kim Kardashian - who I despise also.  That's another review for another time.  Do yourself a favor, research another brand and purchase it.  You'll thank me later."
5,"I've never had a Graphics Card so powerful!  It depends on what you had before, but this made an Amazing change on my computer!  I had Intel Graphics 5000 before, which I say is pretty good most of the time.  But if you want full quality graphics, this is the card for you!  It works great along with my 3.00 Ghz Intel Quad Core i5.  I can run most of my games, at 100% full quality, with No Lag!  I recommend this graphic card with anyone with a GT 560 or less."
5,Nice little speaker
1,"Was not as advertised, received a 1300Mah battery."
5,this one's still working.  Bought one earlier that quit working in a month.
5,Nice
5,"Nice Adapter, love the extra port!<br /><br />~Scarlet"
5,"Not a fake. Great quality. No paperwork, or box. Not sure if they originally come with one. It dose come with a soft bag though. Read up on utube on how to adjust for diffrent batteries."
5,Love the subs but u recommended the wrong amp had to buy another n jus let the other sit waste of money
5,"I am a pretty tough critic when it comes to speakers, headphones, and microphones.  I am an avid music listener and tend to buy the higher quality products because I do not like distorted sound when I listen to my music.  This speaker is very high quality and came charged and ready to play straight out of the box.  I have to say I was very impressed when it arrived.  The design is very nice it has touch buttons to control from the top of the speaker or you can use your device's buttons.  Either way it goes I think you will be very impressed with the quality of sound that travels out of this product.  You can hear all of your 1's and 2's clearly without any static cracking or interference.  The battery life on it is quite good as well I had no problems with it playing for over 3 hours.  It is not cheaply made.  I am thrilled to have gotten this device at a lower cost in return for my unbiased opinion of the product.  I really love this product and the delivery of the treble, base, and midtones.  I would highly recommend anyone to try this product.  This company really doe's make a great speaker for an awesome price.  This is most definitely comparable to speakers that you would normally pay very high prices for.  If you have any questions feel  free to ask me."
3,"Plug was wrong, it did not work properly"
5,Exact replacement.
5,it's excellent.  good shipping.  thank you for sending me my product.  thank you again‚Ä¶
5,"I purchased have.And use them in South Korea.<br />First, there are many good products in Korea.<br />¬† But I do not want this product lcd is attached to the small size.<br />And mini0806 does not have a high resolution, while the product has all the features I want dadeuleo.<br />Excellent resolution, small size, support of 128gb, dual sd card support<br />There are all the features you want.<br />The product has all of the specifications.<br />I will now first be installed on the front of the product.<br />Had not yet tested will create a detailed review once more for the product, and then never used later. Thank selle"
5,Issue free performance
5,"Good product, just as described. No complaints whatsoever"
5,"I purchased 3 packs of chargers over the past couple months, not because they broke but because they were affordable enough to keep one in every room."
2,Product is of good construction however the USB port is only half the depth of a normal port.  This makes it easy for USB devices to be knocked out.  I did not realize this before I installed it or I would have pick a different location.  The hole you are required it drill is much too big to easily cover so it is suck where I originally put it.
1,It's is awful. CHEAP! I will not order anything off of Amazon again!! My order was the first time & the last time! It's amazing you can get away with selling that cheap stuff. I didn't want to give a star at all buy it wouldn't let me just send this review w/o it. WOW!
5,great product!
2,first to open  and this watch - not working  and sler wont to pay return shipping. price this wacht  cost like return shipping
1,The sound was terrible.  I returned five minutes after using it.
5,"Love this cover! the colour is beautiful, and it does what it is supposed to :)"
4,"I needed the plastic fob part, swapped it out with my key, and the buttons work like they are supposed to! Just what I needed...cheaper than a replacement key from dealership."
5,Ignore the bad reviews. the one I got eas absolutly perfect. Machining was great it fit prrfect. There is nothing you could do to this product to improve it.
5,Great product. Works well. Especially great when out/plus isn't close.
1,"Crap. The aux cord didn't work straight out the box. Now the charger cord doesn't charge it. I've literally just bought it at the end of May and here I am, waiting on it to finish breaking so I can order a better quality one. Oh and good luck contacting the seller and expecting/hoping a reply. Super cheap (price and quality). You def get what you pay for."
5,Good product
5,"This is my second iPod nano, the first is a 6th generation. This is a little longer than my other one,but it works great and is still quite small."
5,The antenna looks great and works perfectly
5,"For me this was an awesome purchase. Living in Hawaii I paid a little extra for expedited mailing. I needed it because my old FOB was already junked. The product does exactly what I needed it to do. I followed the instructions for pairing the remote to the brain from You Tube. I didn't see the instructions because I tore it open. Just a note: it takes a while for the unit to catch up so be patient. About 3 minutes after you pair. Also, car alarm shops around my house were trying to sell this unit for more than an arm and a leg. Great price."
5,I guess it works. Didn't find anything at my house. Will use when I travel to satisfy my paranoia. Lots of these for sale at Amazon with many brand names. They're all exactly the same. Just buy the cheapest.
5,"I bought this Garmin after my TomTom XL was stolen from my car. I have to say, I'm very pleased so far.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will answer a few questions that you may have yourself, so that you can see if this is the right GPS for you.<br /><br />Off the bat, the first thing I noticed is how quickly the satellites find your location. Sometimes my TomTom would take a few minutes to locate me, but with the 52LM, it never seems to go over 10-15 seconds.<br /><br />One of the features I really loved about my TomTom was the mutli-line information on the screen. It would list my current time, the time I would arrive, how fast I was going, all on the screen. I was sad at first to find Garmins on screen information was very simple, but later rejoiced as I found you can have FOUR customizable &#34;widgets&#34; on the screen, which closley resembles the mutli-line format from TomTom. For example, you can pick Current Time, Arrival Time, Distance, Elevation (if that's your thing) , Speed, etc.<br /><br />Also, the big 5 inch screen is a plus, almost too big if you don't find the correct spot in your car.<br /><br />Another thing I HATED about my TomTom was that when you added a Favorite, and titled it e.g. &#34;Work&#34; it would delete the address, so if a friend needed the exact address to one of your favorites then you were out of luck, because it simply showed the title of the favorite and not the location. With my Garmin, it STILL shows the location as well as letting you name it! Fantastic!<br /><br />Of course, this Garmin comes with access to other cool stuff including Emergency services.<br /><br />All in all, I think an in car GPS is the best investment you can make, for yourself or for your kids , especially new drivers. Gets rid of the anxiety of being lost and it's accurate 99% of the time.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a powerful GPS that isn't loaded with a lot of &#34;gimmick&#34; features (*cough* like Bluetooth dialing *cough*) then I highlyrecommend this one. Just take caution, because a GPS is like candy to car thieves, which I learned the hard way with my TomTom."
3,You do get what you paid for. 3 out of 4 worked ...had to send them back. Great for kids!
1,"Functional but not as good as expected.<br />If you are looking for something that will convert your car's speakers to your phones then this is functional.  Unfortunately for my situation it did not allow me to control (select thru albums, skip, etc) songs to play thru i connect.<br />The BMW dealer was good enough to give me a free apple 30 pin connector to Y connector.  I did have to purchase the lighting to 30 pin apple converter separately.<br />With the BMW Y connector + (30 pin to lightning converter) + iPhone 5S it is working very well."
5,"all spools look ok  ,I hav'nt used any yet but I feel good about it  A+"
1,stopped  charging after 5 month of use .<br />I have had chargers from Walmart last longer then that.
5,"At the time, all other sellers were charging more for the same exact speaker. Well worth ten bucks, its pretty loud!"
5,awsome
5,works great.
4,lowest price and fast shipping
1,cuts out at higher volumes.....even with no speakers attached it cuts out
3,"I received the item as guaranteed. After a minor alteration, the item meet my needs. Overall I am satisfied with what I purchased."
5,Awesome product !!
5,"VERY satisfied with product. Fast shop/delivery, appear thicker/better ends compared to ones I bought before. Definitely will buy again!"
5,it works as promised.
5,These work perfectly and are wonderful for being able to use the phone while it is being charged since they are so long.
5,bueno
1,UPDATE: it died with less than 6 months of use. Emailed the warranty to the company and they replaced it with a portable battery lol. not impressed.
5,Cables are holding up very well.
5,Works like a charm
5,Best quality built housing  I have bought for my remote as well as the Key material. Note that I have previously bought 2 and they where of lesser build quality.
5,This is the second two-pack of iXCC cables I've purchased. All of them have worked perfectly.<br /><br />The tip of the cable wouldn't fully connect when I had a case on my iPhone. So I used a metal file to grind away some of the plastic around the lightning connector. Now the cable works great whether I have a case on or not.
1,"I purchased these twice. Both times they failed in less than 1 year (1 earphone went dead). I use them about 3 to 4 times per week for lap swimming. When they work, they are great.<br /><br />Tried to get a warranty repair but they don't respond quickly and once I did get an RMA and sent then phones in, I never got a replacement (still waiting)."
5,Can't live without it!
5,This speaker unit is amazing. I use it in my barm. Not only does it sound good but my horse stepped on it and it still works!!  Great product!!
5,Excellent!
4,"really nice, gave it to one of my nieces ...she love it, fun to look at and the color is really cool"
4,Used just about all of the products the price was great.
5,Best radio/dvd player I've bought for my cars and i been through i few very happy with my decisions. Very quick delivery :) thanks
3,The one speaker is broke waiting for replacement sounds good easy to install
5,"This is my second pair of iXCC now. The cable has been with me everywhere I go. It looks identical to the original Apple Lightning Cable (except for the iXCC badge), but I can tell from the way I use it, it has better quality. Highly recommended."
5,love the color and so does my wife.  the only problem is that the hatch button gets pushed when the keys are in my pocket and I have to get out of the car to close the darn thing.  had the same problem with the originals.  user error.
5,Works great
5,These work really well. So far hasn't broken and I have had for about two weeks.
5,works well
4,Works great for TV and entertainment system.  Now I can relax and watch TV without bothering anyone else in the house
1,"Don't waste your money,  it was hollow on the inside."
3,"Quality is fine for the price. Biggest problem is magnet to keep cover closed was not properly secured inside the cover, it easily moves around and I have had to use another magnet to move it back in place to make it stay closed. I recently gave up and just don't both with it not staying shut."
5,Works really well
1,One of the speakers had a crack in is so all the oil came out and now only on shots oil out
5,"I got one for my car and one for my bedroom, I learned from my last iPhone that the one that comes with the phone only last about a year and I need more charging stations. Plus this is a lot less expensive and the quality is great!"
5,Perfect
5,"Just the perfect tool for what I needed.  Because of this, I saved hundreds of dollars."
1,It sucked couldn't get music loaded into it it would cost more to send back I just threw it away cut my losses
5,Great product and comes with warranty üòÄ
1,"Nice, but not worth the price"
5,Worked well!
5,"All iXCC are quailty products and their cables are no exception.. Extremely fast charging, the new element series cables also work perfectly fine with pay as you go phones such as Tacfone, etc..."
5,This is a good product for me. It was long enough for what I got it for and it works great.
2,Much smaller than anticipated.
5,"Bought 4, all of them work ok! They fit smoothly. The cable is a little sticky, though...."
5,very good purchase
5,Excellent.  Feels good and sturdy.
5,great
5,It's a great charger because it doesn't require that you remove your phone's jacket!
4,Great product. Having slight issue with the Bluetooth syncing though (I have an iPhone 6)
5,These worked great. I was expecting it to have some interference with using my phone while it was charging but I did not find anything wrong. That is a big plus.
5,Excellent item
1,Received with Treble not working very disappointed kinda wasted my money on this Item....
1,Cheap case
5,Great price and no complaints on its functionality!  So far so good :)
4,Perfect fit replacement on an 03 4Runner with JBL Synthesis.  If I was more of an audiophile this would not do as the bass is not tight and clean like the JBL but it thumps more than before.  If you are thrifty this will do for you but if you spend $30 more it opens up an entire diff category of better performing subs w/o the need to replace the amp or add a crossover.  I prolly will not own the vehicle much longer but i take my tunes w/bass!  So my rating is acceptably average.
5,Works very well
5,It is agreat one i turn my van audio system to up date system including my cell
1,"I really wanted this radio, it fits so perfectly in my car but it just didn't work well. once I switched to an older driver for the programming cable I was able to program with no issue. testing as a base unit I had many complaints of poor audio quality and was constantly being told to hold the mic closer to my face. problem was it as touching my face. then I tested it in the car. now a new set of issues showed up. If I was in channel mode it would switch the B channel to be the same as the A channel then freeze. it would also randomly make a click sound and kinda freak out. also, the volume is SUPER loud. it was hard to get it low enough before it would just go quiet. really bummed. hopefully they get the bugs fixed. this unit is being returned."
5,Good cords
4,I love it! The only down fall is you can't skip to the next song.
5,Great cables! Top-notch quality and they work with every case I have tried so far. You cannot go wrong at this price!
5,"Worked great on my 2013 Challenger  R/T. Added front, rear and 2 turn signal cameras. Remote was dead, but Coastal replaced it at no charge and the new one works fine. Everything works perfectly now. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
5,"Nook the Simple Touch is a very good eBook reader, may be the best for this money."
5,Great price on a quality cable.  I'm very pleased with this product!
1,Battery life short
3,2/5 ordered were faulty. When they do work though the sound is very good for a tiny unit. I found best to leave the equalizer flat.
4,Easy hookup... Works great...
5,its great work great like it
4,Has been working very well so far but we'll see by the end of this year if it holds up. Was replacing a more expensive duracell charger that stopped working after 6 months.
5,The product I purchased is of high quality and is working great for my needs.  Thank you very much and I hope I'll be able to deal with the same buyer in the future...
5,Seem to work great so far!
3,"Not so great, they work, but they spark and shock you .... they're a fire hazard"
5,Great product and arrived quickly!!!
2,the idea of size imaged does not do it justice. this thing is small. the pouch size is about 2&#34;w x 1&#34;h x 3.5&#34;l<br />I was looking to see if my cellphone would fit in this but sadly not even close.
4,Worked as expected. Not too difficult to setup.
5,Great product! It looks like is built to last. Only time will tell.
1,"It said &#34;downside mount&#34;.  The picture of the product shows it with the mounting screw pointing up.  So, it seemed that's what &#34;downside&#34; meant. This model CT-107D is meant to be mounted with the mounting screw pointing down.  UPDATE: The pictures have been updated and now show correct orientation"
5,Worked perfectly with my iPhone!
5,works fine....quick shipping..thanks
5,So far these are the best non apple chargers I have tried - they are quality and seem like they will last better than any other

5,Worked perfectly.  Incredible value!
5,Awesome cables !
5,"For the kids, they loved it."
5,perfect size works great!!!!
5,"[[VIDEOID:5dd720ea8e29d54b4a435ceb1c855818]]It is the largest over all in terms of size profile of all my USB/AC power strips, yet that sizing does come into play with the very generous allowance it has for a Horizontal Orientated plug, something I ran into with my much smaller one that has the USB ports up next to the AC sockets.  Good spacing too for the bulky vertical plugs, as well.<br /><br />Another subtle aspect that need to be highlighted is the USB ports.  It has two 2.4A ports (labeled as \\""Super Charge\\"") and two 1A ports (labeled as \\""Universal\\"").  It is a bit odd nomenclature, but the practicality is the entire 5V output is 6.8A.  In other words, you indeed can have all four ports going concurrently, each one up to it's own maximum amperage, which is not commonly the case with power hubs of any sort.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations."
1,Didn't like it.
1,That items when I received is in use condition and 1 don't working and the I use whit I lots scratched. .
5,I need one but the price is too hi
5,Great design.<br />Prevents serious injury.<br />One suggestion: It would be nice if the oarlocks could be &#34;locked&#34; in both the upright and the folded positions to avoid accidental dismounts while rowing and rattling during transport.
4,Works very well
5,"Pros:<br />Surprisingly powerful little speaker with some bass to it. More than enough to have your own portable dance party.<br />Sturdy design made of what seems like high quality materials.<br />Convenient and durable little carabiner hook to hang in shower (or where ever) with ease.<br />Super quick and easy Bluetooth pairing.<br />Nifty features like hands-free phone calls (for when you get phone calls in the shower and don't want to destroy your phone)<br />SD Card slot for when I want to play my stored music rather than pairing<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some of the buttons do double duty so read the instructions to figure out how to use them ( Ex: Next song button: short press = next song, long press = volume up)<br /><br />The warnings in the booklet say &#34;do not expose this speaker to rain or wet conditions&#34; even though this speaker is pictured in a splash of water, is called a waterproof speaker, and advertised as a shower speaker...it may not fare long term in my shower. Time will tell!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for a comprehensive review of my experience with it. I would recommend this item to a friend or might buy another at full price for myself, though!"
5,its awesome Bluetooth speaker.. i receive today 8/12/2015 this.. and the sound is loud and nice bass.. for $15 bucks is much more.. i order 2 more today
5,Skar on the left next to a sundown e10 on the right. This thing is awesome. Very well built. Just do not exceed your enclosure size. I have it now in a ported probox on a Audiopipe 1500.1 and sounds amazing. Hits way harder than my e10. Doesn't get too low in the probox but gets super loud. I'm sure it's the tuning of my amp. Still gets low were its set now though. Great sub. Especially for the price.
5,I love it! Sound was clear n crispy!
3,"Initial language setup was Korean or Chinese, took a while to figure out to change to English. Need to add micro card for record.  Manual is somewhat confusing, good luck with that.  Just have to try the buttons and figure them out, trial and error."
5,Great speaker. Just as described. Can use it outside while keeping the phone inside.
5,Great product and excellent range. I can sit in the bed and be on my device in comfort.
5,"This back gate non-oem emblem looks exactly like my original one! I'm more than happy with it. It's very thick and the gold color matches completely. The adhesive is awesome, it's actual 3M. My poor old 2000 Trailblazer was looking sad with the oem emblem all faded and cracked, so I'm extremely happy with this purchase. IF there comes a time that I need another, I'll for sure buy this one again."
2,Should be lot easier to navigate.  I have other smaller MP3 - USB devices that are easier to load and use.
5,Works great and use it with my otterbox defender on my phone
1,My Garmin Foretrex 301 didn't even fit in the case. I was able to eventually squeeze it in there but half the screen was covered up by fabric and the buttons weren't accessible. I have requested a refund.
5,Haven't had any problems with these cables at all.  Like them a lot and at a good price
3,Got for my daughter.  She gives it a 3 because it won't stick to the wall.  But it works with her iphone just fine.
3,Ok
5,"I just got one of these. It works great playing audio books while I exercise, which is all I will use it for. It was easy to load up the content using my PC. I like the included earbuds and the volume is sufficient that I can hear it over traffic on busy streets. After messing around with it for a while, I was able to figure out how to select a book, start and stop the audio and change the volume. It loses my place if I shut it off so I'll probably just leave it on.<br /><br />The problem with the user interface is that the function of the buttons is not consistent from screen to screen. Sometimes the volume button(!) takes you back a screen, sometimes it is back button. There are long pushes and short pushes. Nobody wants to figure out and memorize all of this - my wife wanted to throw it across the room. It would have been much better to standardize the buttons the way Apple did with their remotes."
5,Great alternative to Apple products. Easy to sync. Battery lasts for a significant amount of time. Prefect size for pockets or handbags. Love this thing!
4,For what you paying for they are decent looking/working watches. All worked went I got them in. I'm pleased
5,Excellent
5,fits perfect and is non slip
1,The cable fits very loose and I have to try few times to get my iPhone 5s start charging. The cable gets disconnected easily from the phone and the charging stops. Also the charging seems to be slower than my other chargers
5,"The S8 is one outstanding little Bluetooth speaker. First, it is loud...very loud. The sound fills our entire house. The bass response is fantastic. The overall quality is way more than I expected. Well worth the price, which is not much to begin with compared to others that are way overpriced (looking at you BeatsAudio).<br />The only issues I found were these:<br />1. The touch sensitive buttons, though very cool compared to physical push buttons, are easy to trigger when picking the device up from the top. After a few times of accidentally doing this I learned to grab it from the side, problem solved.<br />2. The play/pause button doesn't control Pandora app very well. It paused fine but wouldn't resume play. It works fine on my Google Play Music app (I have a MotoX 1st Gen) so this may just be the Pandora app.<br />3. I noticed that when charging the device it emitted a humming noise. A YouTube reviewer noticed it to. I did however find a good quality charging adapter and the humming went away completely, so I think this is a voltage requirement or a interference issue with certain adapters or cables."
1,"After having this antenna over a month, I have to conclude it does not work as well as the original stock antenna for the Baofeng UV 5R..also upon much further investigation, this unit I received is definately a counterfeit made in China unit, not an original Nagoya..so basically ripped off on this one.[[ASIN:B00XKTQ1O2 Farmunion¬Ænagoya Na-701 Dual Band 144/430mhz U/v Sma-f Antenna for Baofeng Uv-5r Wouxun Kg-uvd1p]]"
4,"fits ALL CASES, may be narrower than OEM cable. High quality and durable. Won't have to remove phone from any case to charge."
1,couldn't figure out how it works
5,good deal! quick delivery!  A++++++
2,"Works ok, but not durable at all. I bent over to pick up my keys and it fell out of my pocket.  I picked it up in 3 pieces"
5,Sound is incredible. Looks cool. And is easy to set up. My daughter and I use it everywhere.
5,great
5,"If it only would have Bluetooth capability and did not distort at the car cassette player, it would be a dream little gadget."
5,Love it!!
5,Great product.  Works as advertised.
5,"just what I ordered, nice and light"
5,"Good quality, no error messages n would buy again."
5,excellent product came on time works as it says and easy on the system
1,"Stay away. I purchased this to play music for a company party. The case is cheap, the directions are non existent, the unit feels and looks cheap and it couldn't operate worse. The unit is not intuitive even for a tech savvy person like myself and I still am not sure how to turn on shuffle. I got &#34;file error&#34; several times as well as the same song repeating itself. Luckily I had the music in two other places as back-up. I would return it had I not opened it and put music on it."
1,"All other reviews are fake! This camera is a cheap piece of junk, the instructions are not clear, the buttons don't function, the camera does not start up and none of the buttons work! Feels cheap and flimsy, do not believe what the other reviews say! Returning!"
2,I wish so much that directions had been included with this!
2,reception  not as good as I expected
4,HAVNT GOT INSTALLED YET AS BOAT HAS BEEN IN SHOP.  HOPE WORKS AS WELL AS ADVERTISED.
1,I paid for this one an got the ripped off version
5,My daughter LOVED this!
5,Works well in the house or small-medium areas outside
5,"I have other bluetooth speakers but I really like this one.<br />PROS:<br />-it doesnt sound cheap like other bluetooth speaker, I can control the volume from my phone and to the hardware itself.<br />-comes in handy, the size is perfect for travel, you can use it even inside your car<br />-it is a rechargeable bluetooth speaker, you can use it in your bathroom, outdoors and anywhere you want to go because you can just charge it and not worry about plugging it<br />-the sound is crisp and loud and you can adjust it to your needs<br /><br />CONS:<br />You may opt for a smaller bluetooth depending on your style/wants. My husband uses this a lot because he likes the design and looks manly. I own another sentey bluetooth speaker but smaller than this.<br /><br />I recommend this to all family and friends and to everyone who reads this! Just use your cellphone for music then it will be a blast! I received this at a discounted rate to provide honest and unbiased reviews."
4,Works pretty good. I would recommend buying 2 and also the y connector.
5,Awesome and exactly what I needed.  This now allows my Alpine radio to accept audio input from any device's headphone output.
4,Purchased this for my grandson.  He LOVES the kick stand feature.
3,My stock antenna works a bit better
5,"Seriously, this speaker is far better than I ever would have imagined. I'm a skateboarder, surfer, SUP, beach cruiser, pool lurker, snowboarder, camper, and occasionally I shower. This thing is perfect for all. I have the kind of ADHD that needs background sound at all times, so I take music and speakers rather seriously. I've been loyal to my expensive, yet high quality, Nixon speakers for years. I needed a speaker that I can hear from one side of the ramp or bowl to the other and this thing does it in spades. The carabiner is perfect to clip to coolers, backpacks, canoe or SUP deck rigging, tent hooks... or... any place you want to hang a speaker Tommy Boy.<br /><br />As for this little gems features: I use my phone for everything music related. This thing pairs up to my phones Bluetooth super easy, has a great battery life, and sounds impressively clear even covered in water, sand, and snow. If you're looking for a wireless portable speaker that can take a beating, has great clear sound, puts out quality bass, and can even go with you when you occasionally shower, buy this speaker and join the club of happy Arespark owners. Sorry Nixon, but I just found a new running buddy."
2,"No mercedes symbol on back side,  missing.  buttons are very hard plastic.  otherwise looks like original."
3,"Obviously since I hate the speaker, I don't really need this either. However, is does what it is supposed to do."
1,"This speaker does not have volume buttons on the speaker itself so i cannot turn it up, and somehow i cannot get sound to come out of it unless it is up to my ear. I expected more from this considering the great things i have hear about it."
3,"Sound is too low. But for the price, its ok."
5,Works for what I need it for.
1,It worked one day after never turned on
1,"I bought four of these cables to have around the house. Less than a month after purchase, two of four have stopped working. They were not under heavy stress, just sitting on my bedside table and in my office. They worked initially; then for a time, I would plug them into my iPhone but the phone wouldn't always charge. Moving the phone a tiny bit one way or another would either connect or disconnect the charge, pretty annoying. Then they just stopped working, or only charging &#60;15% of the time."
1,"There's no point in buying an item with all fake reviews, I would rather buy something I know works well and isn't resorting to fake reviews."
5,Couldn't be happier! Hooked up easily on my Explorer and is very clear. I was surprised at how well it works at night. Happy I ordered the wired one. No interference. Will soon order 2 more.
1,"Stay away from it.After one year it just decided to quit on me, red light is on indicating that is plugged in but nothing works (tried different cables and chargers with no success).I am out almost $80 because you have no warranty when buying from Chinese vendors.Lesson learned."
4,one for each wife... now I can find them in the compound !<br /><br />best $20 ever spent !!!
5,"Absolutely phenomenal company,<br />I bought a speaker (mind you on a different account) from them at the beginning of last year and had some issues with it a few months into use. Emailed them and got a hassle free replacement. This is why you go through small personal businesses if you can. With this speaker you get a quality product and quality customer service."
4,Side phone holders more sturdy than expected. Enjoy the USB and three plug options. Also bought because of the UL approval which I noticed not all of these have. Only reason I gave four instead of five stars is the white is not a bright white and doesn't quite match my other bright white plugs and fixtures.
4,The speaker sounds great.  Mine did have a manufacture defect but Amazon was quick to replace.
5,"I really didn't think it would last for ten hours like they advertised it for but it really does last that long, assuming you don't use it 24/7 of course. I bought an old ipod mini for the same price and it only had 4gb this thing can carry up to 64gb with a memory card, you can't beat that! The best part is that it plays flac files which is awesome for an mp3 player. Apple has nothing on this little mp3 player!"
2,The speakers sounds really good compared to the hertz hsk165 I sold to try these. I bought 2 sets and made me some custom fiberglassed doors for them but 2 of the tweeters dont work.
4,Fast and easy to install
4,great
5,These are perfect and at a low cost.  I have been very happy with this headset as I make my way through pilot training.  Crystal clear sounds and great quality!! Not to tight and fits great.  Very comfortable! I will be buying more in the future!!
5,"Product met and exceeded expectations for the price. 2, 10ft cables as promised. Connects to all devices I need securely with no slipping. To give perspective, I replaced an AmazonsBasic cable which kept shifting anytime I plugged it into something and would lose connection if I didn't hold it in place. These cables do not do that. Packaging was really nice, I kept the bag. Not much else to say really."
4,Good stuff
5,"I love this, if you don't have a wireless car or stereo this works to make it wireless"
5,Excellent product which is very portable and great sound and volume
5,good
4,"As advertised, on time delivery, functions perfectly. Have recommended to friends who have similar radios."
5,Came really fast and worked really good for what I was using it for
5,It's durable. I hope I can use this for a long time.
5,ok
3,"Received in the beginning of May, and used these cables constantly with no problem. However, by July, they started to stop working (had to giggle the cord to get my phone charged, plugging and replugging, etc.), and then eventually they didn't work at all. It would be great to find a charging cord that lasted more than a few months!"
5,Works great and exactly as it should.
5,good watch
3,"I know this is a Baofeng UV5R in a base station enclosure.  However, it is neat, and I would find it very useful as a base station.  I wish this seller would offer it for around $40 or $50 which would be the fair price.<br /><br />For those barking about FCC, go chase your tail."
4,I was quite surprised at the quality of the sound that was coming from this small speaker.  It's not a high end home stereo system but for something that's portable it's quite good.  The battery life is as advertised and it connects quickly to my iPhone.  Streaming music is hardly interrupted.  My only criticism is that there's a bit of a delay when using it to answer your calls.<br /><br />Overall it was a great buy and I recommend it.
5,Awesome product
3,"Returned mine cause my iphone6 keep saying it doesn't like it. The connection is poor so it hardly ever charges my phone. Then I discovered it was the phone case that was preventing the cord from making a stable connection to the phone. Since the Apple cable works fine with my phone cover, I figure the after market brands should take this into consideration when they designed their cable."
5,"I love this waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, it was simple to connect and the sound is wonderful!  This product is loud and has a lot of bass!  I am very impressed in this little speaker and the power and great clear sound that comes out of it!  This product also has a wonderful feature that took me by surprise as most speakers like this do not have this feature;  this product can be played as a Bluetooth speak but also as an MP3 player if you use the micro SD card slot!  I found the Bluetooth speaker for me in this product!<br />I received this product at a reduced price for my honest review!<br />Wonderful Product!!!!"
5,"Works great, exactly what I wanted. Delivery was speedy. Only problem was instructions were hard to understand."
5,Excellent
4,"This is an MP3 player with a back clip that does a good job of playing songs but the sound quality is average. Not surprising given the low price. The included earphones are really cheap so you have to use your own. This little MP3 player needs a micro SD card to work as the resident memory is just for the operating software. It plays songs and other videos just like any other MP3 player.<br /><br />The touch screen does work ok. For the under $10 price it's still a good value, especially if you just want to load up a few songs to gift someone. There is also a USB cable included to charge this little player. I would recommend also as a MP3 player for walks and exercising as the clip is strong and attaches easily to clothing.<br />[Received free or discounted product to test for a candid review]"
5,Good looking product. Great sound.
3,Nice for price
2,The thing is that no one will cut it because of liability. If they program it wrong and it is not their key...its your loss. So think twice about saving money. If you buy it and don't program it and use it just to open the door...its great!
5,"Great price sound great, vercital installation options."
3,One doesn't work already :(
5,Love pattern
4,"Beautiful watch.  A little large for my wrist, but still a good looking timepiece."
3,"Good product, it works as advertised. It does lose connection from time to time, I have to restart it and it continues to work."
2,"The display screen became unreadable as soon as the clear plastic 'protector' that you're supposed to remove was taken off. There are no instructions. The remove is complete rubbish.  But if you have it tuned to a specific station and plug the macks in, it will play over your stereo. So that part does work and for as cheap as this thing is, you get what you pay for."
5,"[[VIDEOID:fc39bfebf09db0a63f5ba833cc8c7f32]] I purchased this camera this week.  I have a car camera in every vehicle our family owns and each camera is different based on what was available at the time.  I have only had one wreck.  It was at a four way stop and I stopped and was turning left.  The vehicle coming the opposite way was approaching his stop sign as I was going through.  He ran through his stop and hit my rear quarter panel.  Know what he said when the cop arrived.  He said I ran the stop sign.  You should have seen the look on the guys face when I told the officer that I had a car camera.  Case closed.<br /><br />Anyway.  I have learned to buy simple inexpensive car cameras.  I dont need GPS or G sensors.  I do not like G sensors because any vibration in the car or camera mount can alert the G sensor and it will lock the file.  If that happens enough then your sd car fills up with locked files that will not be overwritten like normal files.  That can stop all recording until you erase the locked files.  The description says the camera has a G sensor but it does not. Also, the LEDs for night driving are not automatic and there are only two LEDs. They have to be turned on manually.  Now if you have had cameras with the LEDs for night driving then you know they are pretty worthless because they do not shine enough to illuminate anything more than a few feet in front of the camera which is not helpfull for video at night.  Your headlights provide the illumination.  In my experience most of these cameras are ok at night but you will not be able to read words or license plates.<br /><br />The setup is easy on the camera and the instructions understandable.  I recorded a clip at 720x480 which is one less than the highest resolution the camera offers.  You judge for yourself.<br /><br />I do not know how long the camera will last but I will update if it stops working.  Also dont turn motion sensitivity on unless you need it.  With it off the camera operates like a normal car cam.  It turns on and starts recording when you start the car and then turns off a few seconds after you turn the ignition off."
5,Great item
5,Works well and just as described
5,Was just what we we needed
5,"I've had this for a few years and use it mostly for traveling; I keep it with my bag of connectors, power supplies, etc.  I'm now in the second week of working from a rented vacation home and have been using it nearly non-stop every day.  I listen mostly to classical music and the high, mid and low ranges are all quite good.  Not like my serious speakers or earbuds, but very satisfactory all the same.  Also, it's loud enough for my purposes as long as the family isn't making a racket. The battery life is very good too - I tend to forget to turn it off at night but have had to recharge only once in 8 days."
4,"This is a nice backup camera, especially for the price. The camera just has to be hooked to a monitor or a TV and a 12V power source and it will you'll be able to use it. As for the clarity of the picture, it's decent. It's a VGA-quality picture. In low light, there's not much visibility, and with no light, you can't see a thing! Inside the box, the company includes a drill bit for you to drill out the hole for the camera. Nice little perk! Even if you can't do any wiring in your car, you can still rig this up and mount it, and use a 12V car adapter for it. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5,Was happy to find these. Thank you.
5,I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it. She says it does exactly what you want it to.  It is durable and fun also.  Her watch looks like it was a great burden looks great when you wear it. I wish I had an apple watch also.
5,Great for ammo can project.. Amp Gets a little warm..One thing that I like about this over the other FM radio is it has a display some do not have a display it just seek search
5,GREAT
5,"Purchased this product six months ago, and it has been a life savor for my mother. The only issue she has ever had is with misplacing the transmitter, so it would be nice if there was a locator for the transmitter on the base."
3,The scent does not last very long.
2,"It is really hard to find a personal CD player that works well.  This one will skip VERY easily (even if sitting on a flat surface) so it is not very portable.  I think something on the mode button makes it do things I don't want but the writing on the mode display is so small, it is nearly invisible. That is my biggest complaint because I think it would work better if I could adjust it. There must not be many of us who want to listen to CD's without downloading them to a device or they would make a better choice of personal players. I love to listen to Books on CD while walking or gardening. I think this player has brought me more aggravation than pleasure.  I bought it in March and it still works (kind of) but I think it has lasted so long, because most of the time, it doesn't play satisfactorily and I give up in frustration."
2,Do not buy. The battery on my unit does not charge at all.I am forced to use the Dc input all the time. Emails to Cust Service has not got any answer
5,"This Radio work vey well. I'm using as Crossband repeater , and work continuously 24Hr a day. on mid power. No isuues.."
5,Great item no time limit on amount of car or trucks looked up
5,I love the texture and the lightness
1,It is a POS. this manufacturer is trying to deceive customers. Broke in a weeks time so I opened it and found this. It is a piece of cardboard made to look like a solar cell with a tiny unprotected cell taped on top.
3,"I like this little lightbulb. Also, it arrived very quickly. The app works fine on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. The sound is loud and clear, it can even substitute for your TV speakers (streaming w/ bluetooth). I would have given this an extra star except the light is NOT very bright at all. It cannot fully light a normal-sized room, and perhaps many people won't mind a dimmer room. But I do not recommend using this as a primary lighting source.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this is a nice little functioning device that's a good buy for its price."
3,Sound is a little muffled but otherwise bluetooth connects good.
5,speakers are awesome.have not used the amp yet though
5,"Amazing video card.  Put it in my sons HP Envy 700-147c.  He is driving two monitors with it and HUGE difference.  He is able to turn on more features in GTA.  There was another game that he couldn't even play it and now it works awesome.  I think this is a great video card for PC gaming.  If you are an extreme gamer and typically spend extra on every component, probably not for you. If you are on a budget (IE: HP Envy 700), this card is awesome.<br /><br />Card does not require additional power.  Card is huge and you need to make sure you have room (full length card that is extra thick, ie: might not be able to have a card right next to it."
4,"I love the vamo series mods. They are easy and produce the perfect amount of vvapor.and u can set it to your perfect preference, whether u want a lot of vapor for a great throat hit or u prefer less for a smoother smoke. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is cause I prefer the vamo 's that r variable voltage and variable wattage."
1,Listed as works with iPod Touch 4th generation. IT DOES NOT. Very deceptive.
5,my daughter loved it!
1,Both sets i ordered were damaged..not the packaging but the speakers...enough said!!
1,Doesn't work. At all.
4,"looking good durability. not bad sound.<br /><br />pretty good connecting speed.<br /><br />stable hang on the bag.<br /><br />if, it had more light option it will be bett nice.<br />this look, is so dark and simple.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon."
4,"Works very well, and only thing I think could be better is that it could be a little louder."
5,Good buy
4,"These speakers are fun to own and will do the job for your Android or I phone. Just make sure you connect the speakers to YSB power source ( like samsung charger will do ‚ò∫) and the output cable to your music source and will have a dancing fountain. The beat has to be high so dont expect it to work with easy music. I found it fun when the room is dark and you want to listen chillout music.<br />It has its limitation in terms of output but this is a pc speakers or snart phones speakers. I love them. Kids enjoy looking at them, by the way the water level is low when you buy it and it is meant to be like this. To test its functionality hook up the usb power source the put you finger on the metal part of music cable to see water jump around"
5,"Great product at a great price. Speedy delivery, as well."
5,No more computer charging for my simple lil shuffle.
5,EMY Wireless FM Transmitter with 3.5mm Audio Jack Hands Free Calling and USB Charging Port for Smart Phone and MP3 MP4<br />The EMY FM Transmitter was easy to use.  I love that it has a usb charging port so I can charge my phone and transmit at the same time. I also like that the cord isn't super short like a few I have got and tried to use.  I purchased at a discount for my honest unbiased review per the FTC.
5,I like the mp4 player
5,"I have been using this Holux GR-213U USB GPS receiver for the past two years.<br /><br />I have found it to be of excellent production quality (Made in Taiwan), truly durable and waterproof as stated and has a convenient and strong magnet embedded in the base that allows it to adhere most any iron or steel surface.<br /><br />From a technical point of view, it contains the bullet-proof SiRF-Star III chipset specifically designed for receiving the US constellation of GPS Satellite signals. This is one of the best chipsets in the business -- no Russian GLONASS or Chinese GPS support in this chipset. Later models are based on a different chipset that supports both US and Russian satellites. However this unit works great!<br /><br />Driver software supplied emulates a serial port allowing compatibility with a huge range of GPS software.<br /><br />It also supports the industry standard NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) command set for programming and additional functions can be invoked including the ZDA (1 pulse per second time signal). This also makes it useful for many purposes including serving as an accurate time source for many applications requiring time sync including Amateur radio JT65 and WSPR use.<br /><br />The package comes attractively boxed with all software on a mini CD ROM and adequate instructions plus some velcro and a suction cap to anchor down the lead in your application. I found that the driver was compatible with many 3rd party GPS programs supporting the NMEA protocol.<br /><br />LED flashes when sync is achieved, usually about 10 seconds after connecting to the computer.<br /><br />It does everything that I expect from a USB powered GPS unit."
4,works fime
3,Great product but broke very easily within months of purchase
5,Good price and quality exceeded what I expected.
1,This should be named the &#34;2-Way Ripoff Base Station&#34;.  Do not fall for this scam.  It should cost no more than $50 and that's pushing it.
5,Awesome!!!<br /><br />Awesome!! üòâüòâüòâ
5,Works great - good price.
4,These are great! They are smaller that I originally though though. Both of them do not make any sound when receiving above channel five but it gets the signal. I think it is a setting.
5,"Great kit, excellent mod, easy to use.  If u want more vapor but do not want anything to complicated then this is the mod for u. And it comes with the best battery charger u can get. I would recommend this mod to anyone. Great product."
2,"I have had this unit since 12/13 and it has never worked well.  Backup camera doesn't work with reverse only in mode.  Very slow to boot up and freezes regularly and you have to reset.  I keep hoping it will quit completely so I can justify buying another.  It is typical low cost Chinese junk.  You get what you pay for so Caveat emptor.  The GPS isn't too bad when it works and the sound isn't horrible.  Unless you speak Chinese the customer service is not good.  It does fit my 2007 Toyota Tundra SR5 perfectly and looks like factory with the factory logo while it is booting up.  Spend the few hundred dollars more and go with something better.  The IPod display is horrible as well and it will not come up with songs regardless of how your IPod is setup, mine is set to shuffle and I still have to pick, IPod then playlist then all songs then a song and only then will it shuffle.....very annoying.  The SD card works the best.  I am putting up with it since I don't use my truck very often and it is usually for short distances."
1,"The Battery change only lasted 3 hours.  But, I guess that is a good thing.  Because about 2 hours and 45 minutes in, the speaker got splashed.(not submerged mind you) and it began to act as if all the buttons were being held down.  And it never has worked again.  Definitely wouldn't suggest taking this in the shower.<br /><br />I will say, for the few hours that it worked, it had good sound and volume.  But I could do without the &#34;Power On&#34; and &#34;Power Off&#34; announcements (especially at full volume)"
1,Broke after a week. I do not recommend.
5,Cables work just like OEM and delivery was quick.
5,Good product
5,It is a very lightweight and it has grip for not slipping out of ur hand.
2,Lasted about 4 months before all of them stopped working.
2,Worked for about a week then started working intermittently
5,No problems
1,It's an interesting concept but doesn't really deliver the experience I was looking for.  Hard wired cassette adaptors work and sound much better.  Time to just go out and replace my car audio system with built in blue tooth capabilities.
5,Great dash cam for the price
5,"The only thing I did not find in this article is voice ,or  sound ."
5,"Bought this for my husband, he just loves it. He says now his radio plays under bridges and trees."
5,Fits well and provides good grip and protection from minor fall damage.  It's very slim and doesn't add much to the dimensions of the tablet.
3,"Camera worked fine for about 5 months. Then random reboots. Used different cables, different chargers, etc. Still, after 10 minutes of recording, same thing. Tried to contact seller, no avail. Had to file a claim through amazon. Device still under warranty, but can't get ahold of anyone to honor it. Avoid."
3,"These are almost the exact same thing as the Pyle super tweeters. One IMPORTANT thing to know that will save you tons of headache: If the panel you are installing this tweeter on is too thin, the mounting screws will bottom out on the solder connections of the voice coil to the terminals and cause catastrophic failure! I'm ashamed to say, but I couldn't figure it at first and assumed I had defective tweeters. When I realize what was happening it was very obvious. The supplied mounting screws are long enough to short to the terminals and/or force their way into the solder connections enough to destroy the contact. I ruined 3 tweeters before I figured out what was happening, but fortunately I was able to salvage them by re-soldering the connections. These would be awesome tweeters if the documentation was better and warned you of this pitfall. I wasted a TON of time because of this issue, and not happy. Otherwise, they sound decent when they work."
5,This dash cam is amazing with sharp and has perfect colors. The camera is lightweight and the suction cups seem to stick on for a couple of weeks.  The dash cam also records in night vision. You can also charge the dash cam with a cigarette lighter socket.<br /><br />The dash cam can record with wide angle. You can zoom in 4X.  The camcorder takes 5 megapixels pictures in JPEG format. The screen is 2.7&#34; LCD screen. This car camcorder supports up to 32GB micro sd card.<br /><br />This is a great device<br />I am happy with my order
5,It's perfect! And its length makes it really comfortable! I don't get an error message and they provided quick service!
5,It's like armor. Very comfortable to wear too. Much more reliable than the softer cases.
1,This product did not come with the radio antenna adapter cable.
5,I am very happy with this. I only bought it for the clock and for the Bluetooth feature and I love it. It's very nice and easy to use.
4,Secretly unique designed mp3 player with sd card incuded along with misco sd card adaptor. Very fast shipping
5,Product as described. Worked great right out of the box. Shipping right as scheduled. Product fills a neglected niche in the aftermarket. Thanks so much!!
5,works great on my 05 roadglide
5,Awesome for the money!
5,Works perfect.  My husband is happy to be able to have a cord long enough to charge his ipad while reading it in bed.
4,"I bought this speaker based on reviews on Amazon. I don't know how many glowing reviews were from people who received a free product, but it doesn't matter, I'm glad I bought it. It's heavy, not too heavy to slip into a bag. I think my only complaint is the camouflage paint, but I knew that's the only color it came in. The sound quality is surprisingly clear and can get pretty loud without distortion. It's pretty cute, actually. It was packaged very well, very protected. I like the rubber bumper bottom that keeps it from sliding and I think it will be a great little addition to outdoor fall activities. The carabiner is more useful than I thought it'd be... I can hang it on the towel hangers outside the shower and enjoy my tunes (I had a hard time choosing between this and arespark's waterproof version)."
5,"I have owned many lightning cables.  Most work for awhile and either stop working or will show a pop-up on my iPhone screen saying &#34;this cable may not be compatible(...&#34;, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />Not this cable.  I bought a pack of two so several of us can use them.  we have had these for one week and have used them every day and both cables work perfectly.  The 6 ft length is great, as you can still use your phone while plugged in. Some wall outlets may not be near you and with a 6ft cable it doesn't hinder using your phone like the shorter cable might.<br /><br />The pack of two cables is even less expensive than some single cable I purchased that no longer or never worked.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these cable and thank my son for telling me about these.  He purchased the 3ft lengths and he is happy with those."
5,great replacement bulbs
5,Exactly as descibed.  No issues.  Used it in my homemade electronic predator caller and it works perfectly.
5,it doesn't cause that annoying &#34;not compatible&#34; pop up either.
2,cant control volume
5,"arrived as promised, and product is working well. Nothing remarkable about the transaction which is just how it should be!"
1,"I was really disappointed because like the other reviewers said, the CD player is poor quality. It skipped and wouldn't play certain tracks on the CD I put it.  I returned it."
5,Works well love the blue lighted face
5,Cheap but good. I use this mainly with portable speakers.
4,"Installed in my 91 Infinity M30<br />Great sound quality. Flac support is a big plus! Phone function works well and people can hear me at under 60mph with the top down.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Display has tiny characters and can be hard to read.<br />Wish I could turn off the LED's on each side of the unit.<br />No level adjustment for all channels, only the sub out."
5,"I just received my case and I love it. It snaps in strong and feels very durable. I can not rate how it will hold up, but right now I love it."
5,This was my first mod. It's got the power u want without all the complicated instructions. Very easy to use. Great vapor.
5,it/s uses are very handy
5,"Excellent GPS, I used this during my last visit to Alaska and I was right on the spot with this. Excellent detailed maps with restaurants and quick search mode for any address."
3,not a bad radio but not the best
1,No loud enough. Complete waste. Good as far as connection and compatibility
5,These are great and work with my kindle and my Samsung phone. I now have enough micro USB cables to charge all my electronics at the same time if necessary. Great product!
5,nice
5,Great speaker!  It is much louder and has more bass than I ever would guess this thing could be.  I've gone through plenty of wireless speakers and this one if one of the best.  The built-in carabiner is great and probably my favorite feature is the battery indicator lights!  I couldn't even tell you how many times I've taken a wireless speaker with me only to find that its dead or just about dead when I want to start using it.  So then I'm just carrying around a little brick all day that doesn't play music.
5,Don't work
5,came on time and wires work perfectly. Fast charging wires so thats a plus.
2,"Picture quality is very very poor, I do not recommend"
5,worked as advertised.
1,"One cord stopped working with in a week, very dissapointed with quality"
5,Good long and reliable. I love it. I recommend this product
5,"Works like an original charger,  fast and reliable.  Not sure if 6 feet was too much but with plug ins far away it definitely  helps"
1,"I was looking forward to a great experience but was very disappointed by the lack of quality. The sound was poor and limited, I could only play it to a certain level and also could not get the deep bass sounds on it, was limited in that as well. I'd save my money on this one and invest in a higher quality JBL or Bose."
5,Works great with my iPhone 5s and iPad. I purchased the 6 foot and love the extra length that makes charging easier. I would recommend this product for your iPhone and iPad.
5,Works well and we're not having any problems.
4,does what it is supposed to do  no problems so far
4,"Works Great, Just What I Expected!"
3,works okay only good at about three feet. Battery okay so far.
1,"This is not any kind of filter!! This device is nothing but a switch, there is no filtering built in and I have been ripped off."
5,"This cd player is one of the best that I have bought in a long time. I don't know how good they are on batteries as, I don't use batteries as, I use the plug-in in my boat and the 120v plug where I have to."
1,Cadence wire is copper coated aluminum. thats why the price is so low. It's only good if you're upgrading from some real crappy wiring. anything else is a downgrade. definitely not for audiophile use or long cable runs. I only used it for short cable connections inside of an enclosure. If you use this for long cable runs or inside of a car you are asking for shorts. aluminum is very brittle and breaks very easily. solder won't stick to it so the ends can't be tinned. the only option is to crimp a connector but the wire can't move at all because it will eventually fray and break off at the crimp point
3,The wires for the power and antenna are thin cheep and break easily.
1,Worst product I ever purchased. Lasted all of a week or two and the screen went blank and stopped working. Charging was an issue. Button Navigation was different from what was on the device. Just an Awful product experience overall.<br /><br />Not even worth the price. You get better quality products at 5 Below stores.
5,"Easy to operate,great sound!"
3,Audio is not as clear as it should be.
3,Its a little weird how the audio responses-commands seem to come out in &#34;Engrish&#34; and the sound is pretty good. But it drops the bluetooth connection quite often.
5,"Great little bluetooth speaker, sound quality is amazing and battery life is very good for the price."
5,Do you need a Micro USB cable to charge your phone? Well these are the cables you need to get. They are really nice and they work with any device. Some cable you get from companies it they will only allow you to charge your device and that‚Äôs it. So if you want to transfer data from your computer to your device you won‚Äôt be able too. Well with theses you can do both. So they are just as high quality as name brand cables.  These also work good with the Xbox One controller. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using these cables. I use them to plug my Xbox One controller to charge them or use them as a wired controller. These work great for that. So overall if you are looking for some nice high quality Micro USB cables these are the ones you need to get. Not only are they cheap they are cheap high quality cables.<br /><br />&#34;I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation‚Äù
5,These cables are well made and the coating is thicker than most so should last longer and take my kids abuse.
5,"So we've all had one of those stupid iPhone cables break. And this is a great solution, at first I bought a griffin 6ft cable but it broke after about a month which surprised me, I've had these cables for growing close to the same time and they still look brand new. They're well built, they look good, and they're low profile so they fit easily. Not to mention they have a warrunty! I mean what more could you ask for! As I have said I've bought two sets of two of these and have been pleased so far."
4,Great value. I always check Amazon first before buying any cables. With this you get 2 6ft long lightning cables for less then what you would pay for one
5,"Sound is great, and excellent quality for a refurbished product.  Great deal."
5,Good
5,Works as expected.
4,Good
4,Excellent product that has proved highly reliable and equal to Apple product quality.
5,"Definitely a great product! Absolutely love the fact that this cable costs less than Apple's yet works a billion times better! I would totally recommend this product to my family, friends and everyone!"
1,I didn't like the look. I've had better mirror protectors.
5,These chargers are the only ones I ever buy anymore. I have had several. They are great for price and I can leave one in every room and both vehicles. Highly recommended.
4,"Sounds good for the price, small enough to tote about yet large enough to sound large; also, charge lasts for hours so it can be wirelessly transported about. Very easy to connect to smartphone via Bluetooth but need to manually connect it to any desktop/laptop by selecting connection in accessories menu each time. Also sometimes using Bluetooth interferes with the wifi on these devices (have to switch back and forth a bit). Have not used it in the sauna yet but I'm looking forward to finding out how waterproof it is. Would be absolutely exceptional for the price if it survives the sauna for long. I'm pleased with purchase."
5,"I am a huge fan of the Royce wallet, key and luggage tracker. the crowd gps works great especially in Manhattan and if nothing else, this product gives me peace of mind.<br /><br />As a result, I can proclaim this as a 5 star product worth buying if you are interested in protecting what is yours."
5,Work perfect.
5,Excellent value
5,Have to match every time I switch between kindle and tv. Still have to have this for harmony in my life.
5,"Excellent Product, purchased one for an iPhone that lasted 8 months before the connection broke. They warrantied the item and had a new one in less than 5 days. Ordered a pack of 2 mini USB and haven't had an issue!!!"
5,Just got it a few days ago.<br />Programmed it at home  for my 2008 Toyota Sienna and a local hardware store cut it for free!<br />So far it is working fine.<br />Saved more than a few bucks doing it this way.
4,good product
4,So far so good. It is still to early to say how long these will last. We all go through broken chargers but for the price for two of them this is a good value.
5,Everything we needed in a &#34;Boom Box&#34;
5,I like the quality of output I get from these small size speaker. Its loud and each beats can be clearly felt.
3,"Product description are different with the one it came, gps lost signal often...no bluetooth headset...no dvr dashcam..."
5,I bought this for my son. He likes it a lot.
1,"The worst thing I ever purchased online. It didn't work properly. China Provenice customer service & tech don't speak/write english well. Their solutions didn't work either. After weeks we are still trying to figure it out. It's a long expensive shipping distance to return/and get new GPS. They are not willing to pay all these additional expenses. They want me to pay more, to resolve their faulty product issue. It would have been a great GPS for the money, IF IT WORKED!"
5,AMAZING product! Exactly what I needed for my kids in the car. It fits my iPad perfectly and is easy to install. Thank you so much! And the price was so affordable!
5,Worked flawlessly.  Quick shipping
4,Works fine
5,"Yeah works great pulls in some distant channels  from 100 miles but has Alot of static but channels 0 to 50 miles away are crystal clear. Love it,  would buy again"
4,"This thing sounds a LOT better than I had anticipated. It's not my $100 sound bar, but it's completely respectable when listening to music. It needs a little boost on Netflix, sadly, or it would have had 5 stars. I'd buy it again though. I'd probably rate this at 4.5 stars overall."
5,Great speakers I love them I have 2
5,"Fast shipping, nice product!"
5,Nice Cables
5,"This cable worked perfectly with TechStream v10 and on my 2008 Toyota Sienna and 2015 Toyota Highlander.<br /><br />I did have to install the drivers and Tech Stream on an old WinXP Laptop I had sitting around, but I wasn't using it for anything else."
1,"I purchased this on December 8, 2013 - exactly. When I first got it I used the SD card included (and later a SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card). Updated firmware from website then installed it in the front as Blackvue suggested. Used the iphone to change features within the camera, which was a little of a hassle due to the password -claimed it was such and such in the papers that came with it, and it wasn't. I had to go online and find others that had the same issue and used the password they got in with. Took about an hour to finally get in. Not a big issue once I got in.<br /><br />Checked video, it was terrible. Figured it was the card and firmware update. Checked online and I wasn't the only one experiencing this.<br />Contacted Blackuve and they said &#34;because you purchased from Amazon and you live in the US, we cannot and will not help you&#34; - cut short and dry; they said it ruder / more unprofessional.<br /><br />So I dealt with it, and waited for another firmware update thinking it would help. Updated SD card to the SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card) helped some, but not by too much.<br /><br />Moved the camera done some from the rear view mirror (closer to the dashboard) and it helped a little more. So at this time, it was in the middle of my windshield, but still in the middle. Video was okay, still couldn't see license plates and that is huge with me. (a lot of hit and runs here).<br /><br />Since purchase, it would stop working, out of the blue. I would always leave it plugged in (I *did not* use parking mode; and with my cars, the power cuts off after 10 minutes auto) and from time to time, after starting the car, the recording would not even start until the GPS would kick in, which meant it would not start for almost half my journey. At times, the GPS would kick in, and the record would never start. There were times it didn't record at all, but the recording light would flash. I would get home and there would be nothing recorded. I would check on the phone and I would see live view, but it was not filling up. That happened more than 7 times.<br /><br />It would restart itself randomly. Very annoying, especially when you thought it was recording. I would be in the car over an hour and it would just say &#34;Blackvue for your driving safety&#34; for the first time, after an hour of driving, so I missed all that time. :|<br /><br />It died February 19th, 2014. I had my son look at it and we worked on it together and got it back up and running. And yes, all that happened within 2 months.<br /><br />Again died 2 weeks later. Fixed.<br /><br />Got sick of it and purchased 2 GoPro's used the Blackvue in the back, which strangely, the video was great. I could actually see front license plates, but where I live, SC, front license plates aren't expected; so I only saw tourists or vanity plates.<br /><br />Blackvue died again a month and half later. Had my son look at it because I was sick of it. He said he didn't want to mess with it again, but I talked him into it because I needed it for speed/mph reporting. He said it was due to power. The cord wasn't connecting.<br /><br />Got it working again. Left it plugged in so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and only unplugged it if there were an emergency, which meant if I had to update the firmware, format the card (which you could do in the camera, but mine would not do that), change cards or get info, I couldn't do that.<br /><br />Two months after that, not even a full two months, the SD card function, that holds the card in and let it come out, the spring, broke, so I could not get the card to go in, and I almost couldn't get the damn thing to come out, I had to force it out. Asked my son once again to fix it.. he took a look and said it was not fixable because the way they had it put together inside. I told him he could keep it. He said he didn't want it - and this is a guy who will take anything for his electronics and he didn't want that. So I tossed it. I spent over $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any. I purchased it here and I'm in the US. That's a loop hole apparently because according to Miss Rudy Huxtable (that's a pun, she was rude as a donkey) I wasn't supposed to, or allowed to have it!<br />- Had to constantly check on firmware for it and install it to make sure the video was at least useable - still wasn't. When I'd update the firmware, it was a hit and miss because when you update, you have to delete the previous installment off the card by either formatting it again or just deleting it.<br />- the power cord is long enough for the back (standard vehicle) to the front *but* if you unplug it a lot, like once a week, it will wear out and not power up anymore, like mine did more than a few times.<br />- it lets you know the SD card isn't there even though, uh, it is.<br />- says it's recording, but it's not.<br />- says audio is starting even if you have it turned off via app or camera and aren't even touching it... even wondered if I had a ghost a few times in the car with me ...or bugs.<br />- wi-fi does the same; off.. on, off, on.. doesn't connect.<br />- gets hot even if it's not recording.<br />- video did better in the back BUT I had to get out to fix the plug unexpectedly a lot because of the power issue so it would go in and out of power and I'd be lucky when it would restart, if it would start recording because of THAT issue as well.<br />- other issues, but like I said, it's been over a year and my memory isn't great with this product because I HATED it.<br /><br />For that price, I would rather have a small person or a fairy sit in the back and take notes and hold a recorder. . . . that's why I turned around and got GoPro's.. (psssst. the $129 is *much* better than the more expensive ones.. I got the expensive one first and the cheaper later and it does *much* better than that!) I have the cheaper one in back and it picks up everything .. the expensive one in front.. I just need a dash cam to pick up speed/mph, GoPro's don't do that.<br /><br />I really wanted to like Blackvue, because it's wi-fi, speed and GPS but honestly, it's a piece of junk - at least here [on 'A'] it is.r $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any.

5,"There are only a couple of things I didnt like about this MP3 player. The instructions included with this MP3 player don't apply to this model. Plus, you have to buy an SD chip for the memory. The FLASH DRIVE is just large enough to hold the system memory. You cant store music files on this, unless you buy a SD chip. (They cost $6 for a 16 gig chip.) With that out of the way,  I'm very impressed this player. For starters, they fixed the one big problem, that the older cheap MP3 players had. On older models, you could not access the folders that held your songs. If you had a 8 gig chip, the only way to browse through the music, was song by song. Now they have files set up, so you can scan by band. Once you click on the band file, you can chose the album. Once you chose the album file, you can chose the song. With literally hundreds of albums able to be stored on a 16 gig chip, that makes this a very functional MP3 player. As for the sound, I'm really happy with the quality. The digital decoder, and amplifier is of sufficient quality, to let you listen to music without distortion. Of course, the weak link of the chain would be the headphones. (Don't even bother using the earphones that come with this. Buy good quality headphones or earphones, and use those.) Another issue with these cheap MP3 players, concerns the battery life. Of course its rechargeable, but there's a trick to recharging some Li-ion batteries. (READ BOTTOM OF REVIEW.)<br /><br />So you get a nice MP3 player, that can clip onto your pants or shirt, when you're out and about. It has FM radio (the headphone wire is the antennae, so don't expect to use a Bluetooth transmitter with this, and listen to the radio.) You can record with this too. (again, if you buy a chip.) I suppose you could download a video on this (like a Utoob clip, or gif file), but I don't think it would be worth the effort. Why watch it on a one inch screen? Also, you could download a book, but the screen maybe would show 5-7 words at a time. It would take forever just to read a page. Right now, this player is available for less than a ten dollar bill, which really surprises me. An affordable MP3 player? Excellent. Actually, trading out the SD chips, is a cool option. If you have a lot of music, you can create various SD chips with MP3 files, for your jazz music, alternative, EDM, or folk and classical. By the way, the MP3 player does read WMP files, in case you rip in that format. (As I do.)<br />UPDATE: (September 29th 2015)<br />I've been using this MP3 player at the gym, four days a week, for a couple of months now. It always recharges well, plus it keeps a charge for at least a few hours. I have not had a single problem with this MP3 player. The battery is EXCELLENT on this model. Listen, I've been burnt with inexpensive MP3 players, so I was very cautious reviewing the LiteXim product. I expected it not to perform, and I was wrong to doubt the quality of this product. Considering how inexpensive it is, I have to admit, its one of the best bargains, that I have had the pleasure to review. So I raised the review from four stars to five.  If you want an MP3 player, and don't mind supplying your own SD chip (which are so inexpensive now), this is a good choice.<br /><br />If you do run into a problem with the player, it will be with the battery not wanting to take a recharge. Here's the fix.<br /><br />RECHARGING a LITHIUM ION BATTERY, that wont recharge.<br />Sometimes, the battery will wear out.  You can try to recharge them, but nothing happens. The trick is to remove ALL remaining charge from the battery, before you recharge. To do this, you need to turn the MP3 player ON. You'll get a WELCOME screen, a &#34;LOW BATTERY LEVEL&#34; screen, then a &#34;BYE BYE&#34; screen. Then turn it off. Then turn it on, repeating the process, until the player only FLASHES the welcome screen for a second. Keep going, turning it on, after it turns off, until it WILL NOT TURN ON AT ALL. When its completelydead, plug it into the charger. Now, be patient. It takes DAYS to recharge. I have found, that if you keep the MP3 player turned ON during charging, that it will charge better. (Maybe let it charge in OFF mode, for a couple of days. Then, let it charge in ON mode. ) Be patient. Eventually, in 2-3 days, the battery will recharge. The charge will be good for 4-5 hours, maybe less.<br />NO INSTRUCTIONS<br />You have four buttons. POWER is also the PLAY button. You have the - / + buttons on top, on either side of the &#34;M&#34; button. You need to go into the &#34;M&#34; screen, to access everything like VOLUME, REPEAT, etc. Use the - / + buttons to navigate. The &#34;M&#34; button selects. Volume is hard to control on this MP3 player. You need to find that MODE screen, then select VOLUME, then select the volume with navigator buttons. However, once you discover this for yourself, its fairly easy. I deducted a star, because of no instructions (at least no instructions that apply to this model), and because it doesn't come with any usable memory. Actually, I'd like to say FOUR AND A HALF STARS. ITs a nice MP3 player, even if you do have to supply your own SD Chip. So for the price, how much can you complain?<br />I was provided a free MP3 player in exchange for a fair and honest review.tient. It takes DAYS to recharge.

2,I could not get the unit to sync with my Bluetooth headphones and returned the unit.  The company has an email address for problems.  My email was not answered.
5,"Today 8/10/2015 was the first day of use and the unit work great I like how all the features of the unit work and you can adjust the unit to your liking I used a Garmin 465lmt trucker before this unit and this is a much better unit then the 465lmt I see some neg. reviews on this unit and I think there all wrong people you need to read there manuals and adjust the unit to your liking and it will work perfect for you, the first thing I did when I got the unit is update the software and the maps before my 1st use and  it work perfect I drive a semi-truck thru out the north eastern states and I will update this review as time goes on but from todays use I see no issues with the Garmin dezl 760lmt bluetooth trucker gps I if you drive a sem- truck for a liven go with this unit you will not be unhappy with it."
4,This is an very interesting product. The idea is good but it is not very useful. I used it twice in the last two months.
1,Two broke in one year.  Didn't hit nothing.  I have an 85hp motor so not going fast.  They just crack and fall off after a while - sucks!  Do not buy!
5,Great chargers. Would get them again
5,"Absolutely works as advertised, although I haven't used the phone feature yet.  Hooked up to iPhone via Bluetooth seamlessly, use it to play Spotify songs all day long in my office.  Also love that you can power it via USB instead of using the battery always.  I don't have it turned up loud because of work but this thing gets LOUD if you want it for such a small unit--it's about the size of 1/2 a brick.  Looks nice, works great--just perfect for environments where you can't be loud but don't want to use your crummy laptop built-in speakers."
5,Excellent product.  Works great on my iPad air and iPhone.  Seems very well made.
5,I've bought these for my household and for my mom. So far they are working great. Bought them to replace the original Apple cords which never seems to last very long.
1,I am not happy with this speaker!! It's not loud enough and it needs to be charged frequently!! I would not recommend this speaker!!
5,Great so far.
2,Very cheaply made. Does not fit perfectly into my lighter plug. Works ok other than blowing one of my fuses.
5,Very good quality
1,Not user friendly!!!
5,The cords are sturdy and I live the length.
4,"I was looking for a cute, portable speaker for listening to music in the shower or just around the house, and this little guy fit the bill. I like that it has both blue-tooth and audio capacity: I've plugged it into my laptop too, and movie nights have become way more fun.<br />The only cons I have are that it takes an awkwardly long amount of time to connect to my phone via Bluetooth (about 30 seconds, which is 25 longer than it took my last speaker), and the dual-purpose volume/track buttons. I've made the mistake of not pressing the volume buttons long enough, and it's annoying to have to skip or restart the song. But those are just nit-picky. The sound quality itself is good, and the price was great. I will say that the color is closer to a lighter aqua/turquoise, rather than the deep blue show in the picture, but I prefer it that way anyway!"
5,Delivery was quick product what expectedüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
5,Works perfectly for my iPhone 6plus!
1,After one use the cables no longer work.
5,nice sound and my favorite color  :)
1,I am a REAL REview! Purchased it to try out. I thought the 5 star revews seemed sketchy since they were literally posted back to back each day and they were the only reviews on those accounts. As soon as i got it i plug it in and the screen was already tweaking out and shorting out! returned to amazon same day!
3,"It chareges de phone, plays the music out of my car speakers, but it do not shows anything on my car's screen like the original cable from BMW does."
5,great
5,"So far, so good.  It is replacing a ol' Bose CD player and is thus far keeping up!"
5,"Follow the clear instructions, and that's it. Thanks!"
5,Great sound (even though we can't hear both of them because of an interior wiring problem in our 1993 Explorer!) But the one sounds stupendous!
5,They work as expected.
5,fits nook perfectly thanks
5,Very good
5,great camera for the money
5,Works great and awomen price
5,Good choice
5,So far so good on the Lightning Cable.
3,Doesn't come with screws.
3,Sounds is just ok.  Probably will replace in near future with better quality speaker.
5,Good !!!
5,As described.
5,"Great speaker. It isn't as loud as some of the fancier speakers around, but it perfect for my needs."
1,It broke the first time it was pulled out to check the oil.
5,"[[VIDEOID:6c11c095b941f3576ef72501d99e880]] BUILD QUALITY - 10/10<br />Just wow. You really have to look at the speaker in person, to appreciate its futuristic look. That is mostly thanks to the honeycomb design on top of the speaker grill at the front of the speaker. On top of that, the polygonal-shaped buttons located at the top of the speaker add to the futuristic look. Overall, the design of the speaker is on-point, and nothing like anything seen on other Bluetooth speakers on the market. It doesn't end there - the build quality of the speaker is as solid as it looks. Its matte plastic (soft-touch plastic) construction all around allows the speaker to not draw fingerprints and scratches, and allows the speaker to feel very well-built and sturdy. I don't see this speaker falling apart anytime soon.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - 10/10<br />With this speaker, I was able to get around 8 hours of music playback time, which falls short of the promised 10 hours of music playback time. However, don't get me wrong here - 8 hours of music playback time is PHENOMENAL compared to other Bluetooth speakers in this price range. 8 hours. Of straight music-playing. Trust me, you won't have any complaints with the battery life of this speaker.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 9.5/10<br />At first when I got this speaker, the sound quality was almost mediocre - the overall sound was muffled, and it was horrible. But then when I used this speaker for about 2 hours or so, and let the speakers \\""burn-in\\"", the sound got much clearer. It got clearer to the point where its sound quality is one of the best in its class - well-balanced mids, highs, and lows, as well as just enough bass for my taste. The bass IS a bit overpowering, but I personally like that sort of sound. Vocals and instrumentals are quite clear, nothing crazy, but for a Bluetooth speaker of this price range, it's fantastic.<br /><br />FUNCTIONALITY - 10/10<br />Just like any other Bluetooth speaker and any other device in today's market, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB. The standard stuff, and it works fine, so no complaints there. There's also an AUX port, in case your device's Bluetooth doesn't work, or your device simply doesn't have Bluetooth. Finally, the speaker also comes with a TF (Micro SD Card) slot, allowing you to play music on the speaker WITHOUT ANY OTHER DEVICE! This is quite fantastic in my opinion, as you can just carry around this speaker (with a Micro SD Card, of course), jamming to your favorite tune. Overall, the functionality of this speaker is great.<br /><br />VERDICT/OVERALL EXPERIENCE - 10/10<br />Overall, I really can't find much to complain about this speaker. From its build quality, battery life, sound quality, and functionality, the speaker excels in every single aspect. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a mid-range Bluetooth speaker that sounds better than a low-range speaker, or even your phone's speaker.arket, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB.

5,A very satisfied customer!! The speaker is loud!! Easy to sync and i can bring it in the shower!!! I highly recommend this to anyone!!!
5,"I have bought 8 of this brand and they all continue to work.  We have Otterbox and Lifeproof cases, and the wires fit the openings.  I am very satisfied."
2,"I just received the new soundpal. I preordered and was excited to try it out based on great reviews of the first model. Right out of the box it had to charge for 6 hours. After that I paired it and tried it out. No matter what EQ setting you select on your device or how low volume you listen to your music on, there is a constant humming sound like a blown speaker but this is the first time I've turned it on. Useless as it is SO annoying to listen to anything."
5,Works great.
1,"It's a joke.  Plugged it into computer, nothing happened.<br />I kind of had low expectations because it was so cheap to buy.<br />But not working at all was too much.<br />don't waste your $$."
5,They're great.
1,"Yup Fake reviews ruined a purchase, I saw the other 1 star review and decided to expose this phony camera"
5,Came in very quickly.  It was exactly what it said it was
3,"The unit works, for the most part. The black chip gets EXTREMELY hot when you feed it 3 amps @ 12v, boosting to 15v. To the point it starts to give funny readouts on the voltages on the input side (~3v??). It still seems to function, but really needs a good heatsink to work at the rated amp/hour max for a few hours. It was so hot earlier, the copper coil able to be moved around a little, meaning the solder was starting to melt. I disconnected it from that setup for now, until I find a better solution."
2,Doesn't include chip required to start engine. Only good to unlock and lock doors
1,Did not fit my phone that it says it is for.  Bummed.
3,Found it to be cheaply made. Works great though.
5,Amazing great sound for price
5,Great product.
5,I use it to track flight sim hours and it works great for it. Even has a simulator block
5,"My son gave me his Garmin as he uses his smart phone to navigate now.  However, he did not have this item with the unit when he gave it to me.  Thought it was the wrong size, but the seller assured me the small port would fit and after a little working with the item, it did fit."
1,Delivered with missing two major components....wired and wireless remotes.
5,it was what I needed.
5,"Works great I wired in a power outlet that is controled by the key, so when I start the car the outlet is hot and the display lights up and when turn car off it goes off.  Mounted it so it is visiable by the driver."
1,Arrived non functioning. Had to return.
5,"Excellent!! Sounds is warmer than B-trek S4 which I have returned because of buzzing noise. What's more, I love the touch buttons~~~"
4,Good!
5,Awesome chargers
5,Does the job! Fits to charge my Iphone 5s with a lifeproof case easily. Sometimes the off label brands are too wide but this was a perfect fit. Thanks.
5,InStalled in 78 GMC Caballero Diablo
5,"Has met every expectation!! So far, 3-4 weeks with my 9 year old using daily, i am happy to report no cracks, dings, or scratches!!!!"
5,Nice quality
5,"2006 Toyota Sienna. Worked like a charm (or at least a magic trick). For 2006 Toyota:<br />1) Duplicate key.<br />2) Get in the vehicle and shut the door.<br />3) Insert Master Key (with dot) 5 times, leaving it inserted on 5th time.<br />4) Open and close the driver door 6 times.<br />5) Pull out master key. The transponder dash light should stay on.<br />6) Insert the duplicate key. transponder light begins flashing.<br />7) Wait for transponder light to flash (30 flashes or about 1 minute).<br /><br />In my case the hardware store wouldn't duplicate the key. I tried myself unsuccessfully, however this key snaps open and back closed very nicely and the metal key is held in place with two screws. I ground off the top of an old non-transponder duplicate and drilled a couple holes to fit it in the transponder."
5,Works Great
5,lovin it
1,Didn't even lasted a month this amp started to smell like burn I seen other customers that have had the same problem not worth it
4,"Works great. I wanted to give it a 5.....  but there was something its missing I wish it had.  Can't remember what it is... That shows how insignificant it must be.  I do wish that it would have come with Canada in the system also.  It said North America, thought that would include Canada...Canada must not be part of North America?"
5,"I love this speaker!  We use it for everything!  Even in the car!  This easy to charge, rechargeable speaker can go anywhere with us.  The sound it great at any volume.  There's no static or blurred music that is hard to understand.  The speaker looks nice and is very modern looking.  I cannot stress enough how great it works in so many different places and areas.  It is so portable.  I received this item at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5,Works as expected. We live in AZ and the heat on the dash in the summer can get to over 150 degrees. The suction device has been attached to the base throughout the summer and has not failed.
5,great sound quality ! even had people comment how great the music is from a radio that small but it does go thru batteries!!!!!!!!!
5,This was a god send. Came so fast we were able to diagnose our problem quick. THANK YOU!!!!!!!
1,It really doesn't work.  Slightly better than no antenna.  Total junk
1,Not good
5,"This small little Bluetooth speaker fits in the palm of my hand and looks really cool. The bass on this thing is ridiculous for it's size. The volume can go very high and I can hear it clear from across the house when I turn it up all the way. It does not crackle, or hum, there is no static or interference. Is Bluetooth speaker also comes with an audio cables so I can connected directly to any of my devices if I feel like it including laptop if I want the sound to be louder it simply plugs into the audio jack on the speaker and into the headphone jack onto the device. It has a slot for a scan disk if you want to listen to music off of one as well. It fits right in a purse and I can take it anywhere! Music at the beach, the park, on a hike, camping, even if your car stereo is broken you can listen to it in your car. The battery life lasts a pretty long time I have yet to have it die on me before I charge it up, and that's another great thing you can use it while it charges. These are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and honest review."
5,"Purchased two of these for me and my wife to charge our phones out in the living room. Work as expected, great long length."
4,great help as advertized
5,I love it! Great sound!
5,This product works great me and my friend webougt this for talk and he live to miles away and I cAn hear him great.
5,Connects securely and provides continuous power. Have had issues with some brands not working
5,"The Sentey¬Æ Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 was just delivered 30 minutes ago. I popped it out of the box, plugged it into the USB wall receptacle, synced my IPhone, and got my socks blown off! It usually takes me a week to post a review not with Sentey¬Æ Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8, I knew I had to do it right away. I was expecting the tinny, no base, inadequate volume that plagues most Bluetooth speakers. Not with the Sentey¬Æ Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 my kitchen filled with rich quality sound to the point I actually had to turn it down. There's plenty of reviews on here that explain size, function, buttons, charging, etc they are all great but you have to hear this thing to believe it. It's going on my Christmas gift list and I had been looking for a quality to put in every room and I think I found it and at a fantastic price. The Sentey¬Æ Bluetooth Speaker 4.0 B-trek S8 is awesome in every way! I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review"
5,GOOD
5,ok
5,"I bought this stand for my husband to change his watch.  He was looking for a stand that would allow him to charge the watch next to the bed.  He also wanted the stand to have a way to direct the cord through the stand instead of just dangling out the side.  This watch does that and more!  The stand is very sturdy, looks nice and holds the watch in place with or without the cable.  He really likes this stand will continue to use it.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
5,Great and they don't break
3,some problems
2,Am/fm doesn't work and the volume is crap

4,Does its job. Somehow missed it was a 2 pack... pleasant surprise.
2,"No matter how many times I chose &#34;Scan and fix&#34; when Windows prompted me to, and got the message that errors were repaired, I was never able to put more than 8 gigs of music onto this device. I checked the properties to be sure it was actually a 16 G device, which it was, but every time I would try adding more than 8 G of music onto it the device would crash completely and the files could not be added. I thought my files were corrupted so I formatted the drive multiple times and tried with the same result. I transferred the same files to my iPod so I assume there was something majorly wrong with the device. The device was very cheap fr a 16 G device so I didn't bother trying to return it"
5,Good product
1,"Regular crash, when there is noise!"
5,I bought it for my husband to take with him when he is fishing and doing yard work.  He absolutely Loves It!
5,Fit my stereo perfectly and works great
5,Love
4,Works Great
3,It was ok
5,"Great product. I broke one of them so I bought a couple extra. I like the long cords, charges really fast."
5,"A little stiff, but no problems getting a nice solid connection to charge devices."
5,I love shopping on Amazon. This will help My wife while she sits in the airport.
5,Very long cords make it a lot easier to charge and keep the phone closer and having a second one can't hurt if you want to keep one in the car or at work.
1,"This Fujifilm one-time use camera is a total POS, piece of garbage, and should be used zero times!  I rate it with NEGATIVE 5 stars, since zero stars would be too good for it . This camera should not even be allowed to be sold.  I took it with me on my cruise vacation, hoping to capture some nice shots in and near the water, but all I got was the reflection of the translucent covering on top of the lens.  For some stupid reason, the manufacture designed the camera with a waterproof case made of very poor clarity plastic that totally screws up the quality of every single picture it takes.  The lens focused only on the plastic case on every picture, so every picture was just a picture of the plastic case, with what I really wanted to take a picture of just the showing has some blurry blob in the background.  Did any moron at Fujifilm ever actually test this camera first, before putting it on the market? Can I get my money back, and a written apology, Amazon? This product is a total disgrace! PLEASE do not waste your money on this worthless camera!"
5,Best iphone cable!
5,Worked great!
5,I bought this for a friend and the day I got it we used it to charge her phone.  While we drove to a movie and after the movie on the way to get a pizza.  The charge worked as advertised.
5,fits perfect
5,"My grandson got this for his birthday and he loves it, the sound is very good for the price and it seems well made."
5,I ordered this for my husband and so far he likes the bass and it has a excellent sound in his car. The speakers are the best so far as per my husband and the price was right.
1,I read the reviews and half said it worked half said it didn't in the Audi. I have an 2011 Audi A4 and it did not work. It does charge your phone but you can't play music through it. It says it doesn't support this device. On top of that it came all bent up I couldn't get the USB to connect so I had to bend it back into place. Maybe put it in better packaging if it's that easily bendable.
4,works. light weight.
5,Great case for the price
5,Excellent speakers. Unbelievable sound for the size of the speaker.
5,Very cute and has proven durable with a 6 year old who had dropped it many times.
5,very good
5,Kick butt for an 8inch sub.  Very pleased
5,They rock
5,Great color and just as expected.  Great fit and excellent price!
5,Arrived very quickly and I managed to fit the new screen in 30 minutes (plenty of instructions on youtube). Very good quality and got my Garmin Nuvi 2440 back in operation at a very reasonable cost. Just remember to have the small screwdrivers and plastic &#34;podger&#34; to hand to safely take the GPS apart. You also have to be very careful when opening and closing the small connector to the screen.
2,Amp seam to not work but speaker is pretty good.
5,"The 1-feet length is perfect for carrying, leaving in the car, and making my charging station tidy. I got two sets and very happy."
2,Cheap product not worth the price. The edges broke in days and the supernatural background is hard to see
5,smooth deal!!!!
4,"The 3' cables are the perfect length to use with outlets and computers. The jacket feels a little tougher than the original Apple cable and the construction feels better overall. Since this product is MFi certified, it's guaranteed to work with your iPhone/iPod/iPad and you'll no longer have to worry about that annoying popup you get when using non-certified cables."
1,"played one time quit, wont take a charge."
5,Excellent pillow speaker turns out to be exactly as described and what i was hoping for stuff it in my pillow plug it into my Mp3 player (That i also got on here with up to 70 hours of play time) crawl under the sheets snuggle in and listen to my tunes of to dream world in no time  100% satisfied with this product and would recommend to others friends and family also .....
4,"I't was exactly what I was looking for, just like the description in the review."
3,instructions very hard to understand.  It is not user friendly. Cannot get to soft ware to work on the radio.  Radio is good when you get it programed.<br />instructions on the internet are confusing as there appears different versions for the same radio.
5,Solid. Nuff said.
4,Was delivered on time and everything but it was a bit of a hassle to get after getting it replaced.
5,"Wow, this groovy green bluetooth speaker packs a big sonic punch, and it's weatherproof, I love it! Got this as a gift, upon opening thought it was awfully cute, but would it rock? The answer is, yes, yes it does! This little guy sounds amazing! Mobile, rechargeable, plus a mic for handsfree calling or voice commands. Works easily and intuitively, bluetooth connected right away, and there is even a jack for hooking up non bluetooth enabled devices. Just brilliant, this is such a great bluetooth speaker, I want to buy one for everyone I know."
4,Works well<br />what i did not see in the info on this gauge is that it flips back and forth between volts and oil pressure
5,Great product! My daughter loves switching the colors of the case for her iPod.
1,"Sounded like an radio that never hits the station. The songs blended together. Weird product, I didn't like this."
5,work good
5,works as advertised.
