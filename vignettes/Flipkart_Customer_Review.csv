I received a quick delivery from flipkart. The headphones are light weight and foldable which makes it easy to carry. Sound quality is decent. Bluetooth connectivity is very good. The only negetive aspect of this device is the call quality. It's terrible. You can hear the other person but the microphone on this device is so poor that you won't be audible on the other end. It definitely doesn't support handsfree calling. I tried using the cable to call but again it didn't improve much. This is...READ MORE,3

The optimal sound can be achieved through equilizer only. Pairing it is fairly easy. Battery is also decent. The ear puffs are not too comfortable. A little bigger and softer puffs would have been great. The build quality is also fairly decent. The only issue I faced was with the microphone. Others were not able to hear me proper...READ MORE,3

sound qaulity is normal (lack of clarity because of higher bass) and only bass is excellent. If any one who wants sound clarity then switch on Sennheiser cx275s.  I've already used it and got a better quality of sound in balanced.READ MORE,3
"I have used it for a while now and I noticed everything that u should notice to write a review. It's really not for long use, you should use for 1 hour continuously, give it some rest and again use. My ears are big so they pain a little. The sound quality is Very amazing. The treble and Bass are perfectly balanced and you can clearly tell difference between base and Treble. Vocals are clear along with powerful bass. At 899 it's a must buy. I'm very much satisfied with the sound quality.READ MORE",4

Review after using it for a while-1. Sound Quality- 35Not the best sound at this price point. I'm an audiophile & a music producer so I've tried lots of headphones. Sounds are a bit muffled. Low frequencies are boosted so better base. Mid are boosted a little so voice parts are loud. But higher frequencies are very low. Unless you use an equilizer you might not get the best experience. Mic is also average. Capturing strength isn't that great. You might have to shout while talking. Compared...READ MORE,3

Headphones are of great quality build wise and if one needs to hit nirvana while traveling. Somehow the option of using the headphones with Wire is not as pleasant of a listening experience as it is with the BT.

I am writing this review after 1 week of usage.The product is good for first time users. Sounds is good and built quality is okay. If you are thinking to play PUBG then you won't be able to play. The Bluetooth lags while playing. You can play the game using aux cable. I bought for 1500.The headphones are tight and need to be adjusted after every 20 to 30 mins. At last it is good for normal usage.READ MORE,4
"Nice headphones in budget. The sound quality and bass is superb and is design is also very impressive. But the only thing which should be noted down that these headphones are really fit on ears. When you hear songs for half and hour, you feel pain in your ear. Because of that pain, mood goes off. This thing should be fixed. After all, these headphones are good 🎧🎧👍READ MORE",4

"Headphone ear cup pads are not that much comfortable. It is made of fine quality. Ears starts to sweat and pain when used for longer period of time. Other issue, microphone doesn't work when connected to bluetooth, for that you need to disconnect it first and then plug wire to use it(mic) like when you are receiving calls which is really disturbing! Best alternative to this is Moto Pulse which I have used, most of the things between both are of same quality but Moto is more comfortable.READ MORE",3

Packaging was good. As usual ontime delivery by Flipkart. Regarding the product it's best out there in the market for its price. The only Con is ears start to pain after an hour or so. The cushion on the earpods is good. The build quality is topnotch for the price point. It comes with 3.5mm audio jack as well. In case you run out of battery you can always rely on the conventional wire setup and continue your journey of listening to music ) Over all a great product for 1.4k.READ MORE,4
